A build can be _pinned_ to prevent it from being removed when a clean-up procedure is executed, as stipulated by the [clean-up policy](clean-up.md).

To pin/unpin a build:
* on the [Build Results page](working-with-build-results.md), select __Pin__ in the _Actions_ drop-down menu
* on the __Overview__ tab of the __Build Configuration Home__ page, select the __Pin__ build action

The _Pin/Unpin_ build dialog also allows you to tag the build.

If the build has snapshot dependencies, the _"Apply to all snapshot dependencies"_ box appears. Check this box to apply the actions (pinning/unpinning, adding / removing tags) to all dependency builds of the current build.
