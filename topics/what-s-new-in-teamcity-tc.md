* The [](artifacts-migration-tool.md) now supports migration to and from Microsoft Azure storages. This tool allows you to easily transfer build artifacts from one storage to another. Note that you need to install an unbundled plugin to set up Azure storages: [Azure Artifact Storage](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9617-azure-artifact-storage).
