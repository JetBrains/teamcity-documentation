__Since TeamCity 2019.1__, the following security actions are available on the __Administration | Authentication__ page:
* __Logout all users__: log out all currently logged in TeamCity users. This will also delete all _Remember me_ cookies.
* __Delete all access tokens__  (available if [token-based authentication](configuring-authentication-settings.md#Token-Based+Authentication) is enabled): delete all generated personal access tokens server-wide.
