This page lists the options to manage the queue builds manually. Automatic build queue optimization is detailed in the [separate section](build-queue.md#Build+Queue+Optimization+by+TeamCity).

## Manually Reordering Builds in Queue

To reorder builds in the [Build Queue](build-queue.md), you can drag them to the desired position.

### Moving Builds to Top

* For any queued build, do one of the following: 
   * on the [Build Queue](build-queue.md) page, click the arrow button next to the build sequence number ![moveToTop.png](moveToTop.png) to move the build to the top of the queue.
   * click the build number or build status link anywhere in the UI, and, on the [queued build ](working-with-build-results.md)page, click the __Actions__ menu in the top right. Select the __Move to top__ action. The queue position will change. For a composite build, the whole build chain will be moved to the top of the queue.
 * For a running composite build which has dependencies that have not yet started, click the build number or build status link anywhere in the UI, and, on the [running build](working-with-build-results.md) page, click the __Actions__ menu in the top right. Select the __Move queued dependencies to top__ action. All queued dependencies of this build will be moved to the top of the queue.

## Managing Build Priorities

By default, builds are placed in the build queue in the order they are triggered: most recently triggered build is add to the bottom of the queue. It is possible to change build's priorities so that builds are inserted into the build queue at a position depending on their defined priority and the wait time of the currently queued builds.

In TeamCity you can control build priorities by creating _Priority Classes_. A priority class is a set of build configurations with a specified priority (the higher the number, the higher the priority. For example, `priority=2` is higher than `priority=1`). The higher priority a configuration has, the higher place it gets when added to the Build Queue.   
To access these settings, on the __Build Queue__ tab, click the __Configure Build Priorities__ link in the upper right corner of the page.

Note that only users with the __System Administator__ role can manage build priority classes.

By default, there are two predefined priority classes: _Personal_ and _Default_, both with `priority=0`.
* All personal builds ([Remote Run](remote-run.md) or [Pre-tested Commit](pre-tested-delayed-commit.md)) are assigned to the _Personal_ priority class once they are added to the build queue. Note that you can change the priority for personal builds here.
* The _Default_ class includes all the builds not associated with any other class. This allows creating a class with priority lower than default and place some builds to the bottom of the queue.

To create a new priority class:
1. Click __Create new priority class__.
2. Specify its name, priority (in the range `-100..100`) and additional description. Click __Create__.
3. Click the __Add configurations__ link to specify which build configurations should have priority defined in this class.

This setting is taken into account only when a build is added to the queue. To ensure that builds with lower priority always have a chance to run, TeamCity also considers how long each build is staying in the queue. This allows running a long awaiting build with lower priority before the recently added builds with higher priority. For a detailed explanation of this behavior, refer to the [algorithm description](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TW/Build+Queue+Priorities#BuildQueuePriorities-Algorithmdetails).

## Removing Builds From Build Queue

To remove build(s) from the queue, check the __Remove__ box next to the selected build and confirm the deletion. If a build to be removed from the queue is a part of a build chain, TeamCity shows the following message below the comment field: "This build is a part of a build chain". Refer to the [Build Chain](build-chain.md#Stopping%2FRemoving+From+Queue+Builds+from+Build+Chain) description for details.

Additionally, you can:
* Remove all your personal builds from the queue at once from the __Actions__ menu.
* Remove several builds of [paused build configurations](build-configuration.md#Pausing+%2F+Activating+several+build+configurations+of+a+project) from the queue.

## Limiting Maximum Size of Build Queue

It is possible to limit the maximum number of builds in the queue. By default, the limit is set to 3000 builds. The default value can be changed using the `teamcity.buildTriggersChecker.queueSizeLimit` [internal property](configuring-teamcity-server-startup-properties.md#TeamCity+internal+properties).

When the queue size reaches the limit, TeamCity will pause [Configuring Build Triggers](configuring-build-triggers.md). Automatic build triggering will be re\-enabled once the queue size gets below limit. While triggering is paused, a warning message is shown to all of the users.

 While __automatic__ triggering is paused, it is still possible to add builds to the queue [manually](triggering-a-custom-build.md).
