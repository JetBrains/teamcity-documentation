TeamCity comes with the built-in support of the .NET toolchain providing the .NET build step, .NET detection on the build agents, and autodiscovery of build steps in your repository.

This page gives details on configuring the _.NET_ runner. For a tutorial and demo, see this [blog post series](https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2020/12/teamcity-integration-with-net-part-1-new-approach-and-demo/).

<note>

Since TeamCity 2019.2.3, the .NET CLI (dotnet) build runner has been refactored and renamed to __.NET__ thus emphasizing that now it supports all .NET-related operations previously implemented in TeamCity as multiple build runners.

Note that we stop providing active support for the [MSBuild](msbuild.md), [Visual Studio (sln)](visual-studio-sln.md), [Visual Studio 2003](visual-studio-2003.md), and [Visual Studio Tests](visual-studio-tests.md) runners. These runners are left for compatibility of existing build configurations with new versions of TeamCity. To receive the following updates and use extra features of our .NET implementation, we suggest that you select the .NET runner instead of any listed runner in all corresponding build steps. This page describes the settings of all supported .NET commands and gives [guidelines on migration from the obsolete build runners](#Migrating+from+Deprecated+Runners+to+.NET+Runner).

</note>

## Requirements

The .NET runner requires the following software to be installed on a build agent machine:

<table>
<tr><td>Command</td><td>Required software</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>

[.NET CLI commands](#Build+Runner+Options)   
(including cross-platform `msbuild` and `vstest`)

</td>
<td>

* [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/) (versions 1–3.1)   
   _or_
* [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) (version 5.0 or newer)
</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

`msbuild` command via `msbuild.exe`   
(if Windows-only MSBuild version is selected)

</td>

<td>

* Visual Studio (version 2010 or later)   
   _or_
* Visual Studio Build Tools (2010 or later)   
   _or_
* .NET Framework Developer Pack (version 4.5 or later) with .NET SDK

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

`vstest` command via `VSTests.Console.exe`   
(if Windows-only VSTest version is selected)

</td>

<td>

* Visual Studio (version 2010 or later)   

</td>

<tr>

<td>

`devenv` command

</td>

<td>

* Visual Studio (version 2010 or later)

</td>

</tr>

</table>

### .NET Version Detection Algorithm

TeamCity searches for the .NET executable files in the following order:
1. In the directory defined in the environment variable `DOTNET_HOME` for a TeamCity agent. For example, `DOTNET_HOME=D:\SDK\dotnet\`.
2. In the default directory for the .NET executable file:
   * Windows: `C:\Program Files\dotnet` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet`, or other default program files directory (depending on the environment variable `ProgramW6432`)
   * Unix: `/usr/share/dotnet`
   * Mac: `/usr/local/share/dotnet`
3. In paths specified in the `PATH` environment variable.

TeamCity will use the first .NET version it finds. If you have several .NET versions installed, we recommend that you specify the most recent version in the `DOTNET_HOME` variable.

## Build Runner Options

Currently, the .NET runner supports the following commands:

* Basic .NET CLI commands:
   * [`build`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build)
   * [`clean`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-clean)
  * [`restore`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore)   
  (requires .NET CLI 2.1.400+ for authentication in [private feeds](#Authentication+in+Private+NuGet+Feeds))
  * [`pack`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-pack)
  * [`publish`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish)
  * [`run`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run)
  * [`test`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test)
* Advanced commands:
     * [`msbuild`](#msbuild)\*
     * [`vstest`](#vstest)\*
     * [`nuget delete`](#nuget+delete)   
     (requires .NET CLI 2.1.500+ for authentication in [private feeds](#Authentication+in+Private+NuGet+Feeds))
     * [`nuget push`](#nuget+push)   
     (requires .NET CLI 2.1.500+ for authentication in [private feeds](#Authentication+in+Private+NuGet+Feeds))
* Visual Studio command-line mode (read more in the [Visual Studio reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/devenv-command-line-switches)):
  * [`devenv`](#Visual+Studio+Command-Line+Mode)
  
\* _`msbuild` and `vstest` are executed as [CLI commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/) if cross-platform .NET SDK is used for building a project. Otherwise, they are run using the `msbuild` or `VSTest.Console` tool respectively._

Alternatively, you can specify any __[custom .NET command](#Custom+Commands)__, and TeamCity will run it _as is_.

## Basic Commands

The set of .NET runner's options depends on the selected command. Available options for basic .NET CLI commands are:

<table><tr>

<td>

## Advanced Commands

### msbuild

The `msbuild` command is used for building a project and all its dependencies with the Microsoft Build Engine.   
Depending on the selected MSBuild version, `msbuild` can either be run as the [cross-platform .NET CLI command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-msbuild) or as the [Windows-only `msbuild.exe` tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild).

The `msbuild` command shares some of the common options with the basic CLI commands of the .NET runner (see the [corresponding section](#Basic+Commands) for more details).

Supported MSBuild versions: 4 or later / 12 or later.

MSBuild-specific settings are:

<table><tr>

<td>

Option

</td>

<td>

Description

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

Targets

</td>

<td>

List of targets separated by a space or semicolon. A target is an arbitrary script for your project purposes. Click the list icon next to the field to view available targets.

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td id="msbuild-version">

MSBuild version

</td>

<td>

Specify the version of the installed MSBuild engine. To ensure that a specific version of native MSBuild is used (for example, in a Docker container), you need to set the path to `MSBuild.exe` in the `PATH` environment variable.

See the [Requirements](#Requirements) section for more details.

If you set the version in this field and choose to run the current step using Docker (with [](container-wrapper.md)), make sure to specify the path to `MSBuild.exe` in the `PATH` environment variable. This way, the .NET runner will be able to find the required executable file even within the Docker container.

</td>

</tr>

</table>

### vstest

The `vstest` command is used for testing a project with the VSTest engine and automatically importing the test results. Depending on the selected VSTest version, `vstest` can either be run as the [cross-platform .NET CLI command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-vstest) or as the [VSTest console](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9056-vstest-console-runner).

Supported VSTest versions: 2013 or later.

The `vstest` command shares some of the common options with the basic CLI commands of the .NET runner (see the [corresponding section](#Basic+Commands) for more details).

VSTest-specific fields are:

<table><tr>

<td>

Option

</td>

<td>

Description

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td id="vstest-assemblies">

Test assemblies

</td>

<td>

Specify the new-line separated list of paths to assemblies to run tests on. [Wildcards](wildcards.md) are supported.<br/><br/>
Paths to the assemblies must be relative to the [build checkout directory](build-checkout-directory.md).

</td>

</tr>


<tr>

<td>

Excluded test assemblies

</td>

<td>

The new-line separated list of paths to assemblies that the `vstest` command should ignore. [Wildcards](wildcards.md) are supported.<br/><br/>
Paths to the assemblies must be relative to the [build checkout directory](build-checkout-directory.md).

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td id="vstest-version">

VSTest version

</td>

<td>

Specify the installed version of VSTest. See the [Requirements](#Requirements) section for more details.

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td id="vstest-platform">

Platform

</td>

<td>

If necessary, specify the target platform: x86, x64, or ARM. Leave _\<Auto\>_ to use the platform selected by VSTest.

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td id="vstest-isolation">

Run in isolation

</td>

<td>

Select to run the tests in an isolated process.

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

Test filtration

</td>

<td>

Select the test filtration mode:
* _Test names_: Of all tests discovered in the included assemblies, only the tests with the names matching the provided values will be run. For multiple values, separate them with a new line. If the field is empty, all tests will be run. See details in the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/vstest-console-options?view=vs-2022#general-command-line-options).
* _Test case filter_: Run tests that match the given expression. See details in the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/vstest-console-options?view=vs-2022#general-command-line-options).

See also: [Run selected unit tests](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/selective-unit-tests?pivots=mstest)
</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td id="test-retry">

Test retry count

</td>

<td>

In the event of a test failure, TeamCity can seamlessly initiate automated re-runs of said test during the same build run. Failed tests are re-launched until they either achieve success or exhaust the maximum number of attempts. This technique allows you to identify [flaky tests](investigating-and-muting-build-failures.md#Flaky+Tests) and distinguish them from genuinely problematic tests that consistently fail regardless of the number of launch attempts.

Tests that initially failed but managed to finish successfully during subsequent re-runs are automatically muted. You can check the [Tests tab](build-results-page.md#Tests+Tab) of a build results page to see how many re-runs were required for each test.

<img src="dk-test-rerun-flaky.png" width="706" alt="Flaky tests during a re-run"/>

<warning>

Current limitations:

* The maximum number of test retries is limited by 1000.
* Granular retries of parametrised tests are not supported. Tests like <code>[Theory]</code> in XUnit and NUnit or <code>[DynamicData]</code> in MSTest are retried with all their parameters. See this ticket for more information: [TW-86141](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-86141/Parameterized-test-retry-in-.NET-Plugin).
* [TeamCity.VSTest.TestAdapter](https://github.com/JetBrains/TeamCity.VSTest.TestAdapter) is supported starting with version 1.0.40.
* [Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk) of versions 16.0 and newer are supported.
* The runner uses the `/TestCaseFilter` option of the VSTest.Console.exe tool to separate and re-run failed tests. Since `/TestCaseFilter` [cannot be used](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/vstest-console-options?view=vs-2022) along with the `/Tests` option, failed tests cannot be automatically re-run if you manually filter tests by their names (set the runner's **Tests filtration** option to "Test names").

</warning>

<tip>

Re-running failed tests is also available for the `test` command.

### nuget delete

TeamCity provides full support for the [`nuget delete`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-nuget-delete) command.

### nuget push

TeamCity provides full support for the [`nuget push`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-nuget-push) command.

### Visual Studio Command-Line Mode

The .NET runner supports the Visual Studio command-line mode with the [`devenv`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/devenv-command-line-switches) command.

Devenv allows configuring custom options for the IDE, build, debug, and deploy projects from the command line using different [switches](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/devenv-command-line-switches#devenv-switch-syntax).

`devenv` shares some of the common options with the basic CLI commands of the .NET runner (see the [corresponding section](#Basic+Commands) for more details).

>Before running Visual Studio from TeamCity under a specific user, we highly recommended launching it in the UI mode from this user's account at least once. On the first start, VS usually displays pop-up dialogs which might hang a build running the `devenv` command. Once closed during the first launch, these dialogs won't be generated during the following launches in the devenv-mode and no hanging will occur.
>
{style="note"}

Devenv-specific fields are:

<table><tr>

<td>

Option

</td>

<td>

Description

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td id="devenv-build-action">

Build action

</td>

<td>

Select one of the supported switches: `clean`, `rebuild`, `build`, or `deploy`.

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

Visual Studio version

</td>

<td>

If necessary, specify the version of the installed Visual Studio. Leave _\<Any\>_ to use the latest installed version.

See the [Requirements](#Requirements) section for more details.

</td>

</tr>

</table>

<note>

Note that Devenv does not provide functionality for displaying a structured build log or test reports. Its main purpose is to allow using custom switches and add-ins for Visual Studio.

</note>

### Custom Commands

Since TeamCity 2020.1.1, the .NET runner allows launching any custom .NET command or executable file as is.

The runner provides the following settings for the _\<custom\>_ command option:
* _Executables_
* _Command line parameters_
* [Working directory](#working-directory)
* [.NET coverage](#Code+Coverage)
* [Docker settings](#Docker+Settings)

The _Executables_ field expects files with the `.com`, `.exe`, `.cmd`, `.bat`, `.sh`, `.dll` extensions as well as files with no extension. You can specify multiple executable files, separated by a new line.

The _Command line parameters_ field allows entering any custom command or arguments to complement the specified executable.

Depending on the entered settings, the .NET runner will transparently treat each custom command. Refer to the following list for common use case examples:

<table>

<tr>
<td>Use case</td>
<td>Executables</td>
<td>Command line parameters</td>
<td>Result</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

[Install](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-tool-install) the specified .NET Core tool on your machine

</td>

</td>
<td>

build_src.sh   
build_doc.sh

</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>


</table>

## Docker Settings

The .NET CLI build step can be run in a specified [Docker container](container-wrapper.md).

## Code Coverage

[JetBrains dotCover](jetbrains-dotcover.md) is supported as a coverage tool for `msbuild`, `test`, `vstest`, and a number of custom commands. To merge snapshots produced by multiple individual .NET runners into one consolidated report, add the [](dotcover-runner.md) to your configuration.

## Authentication in Private NuGet Feeds

TeamCity allows you to authenticate using private NuGet feeds. Read more in [NuGet](nuget.md#Authentication+in+private+NuGet+Feeds).

## Parameters Reported by Agent

When starting, the build agent reports the following parameters:

<dl>

<include from="predefined-build-parameters.md" element-id="dotnet-related-properties"/>

</dl>


### Migrating from Deprecated Runners to .NET Runner

### Migrating from MSBuild Runner

Since TeamCity 2019.2.3, the .NET runner is the recommended method for building projects with the MSBuild engine. We have included the `msbuild` command to our refactored .NET runner to ensure long-term support of the .NET platform development strategy.

You can safely switch [MSBuild steps](msbuild.md) in your existing build configurations to the .NET runner. Make sure to copy all additional command-line parameters and other important settings to the new runner. See the [`msbuild`](#msbuild) section for more details on the settings available in the .NET runner.

Additional features you will get in the .NET runner are:
* Support of cross-platform MSBuild for .NET projects.
* Ability to build a project for a different platform specified in the _Runtime_ field.
* Ability to run the project in a Docker container with our [](container-wrapper.md) extension.

Consider the following notes before migrating:
* The .NET runner uses x86 run platform by default. If the x86 version is not available, it will use x64.
* The .NET runner provides code coverage only for [dotCover](jetbrains-dotcover.md).
* Mono is not supported with this runner.

If you are actively using either Mono or NCover/PartCover in your MSBuild steps, please let us know about it via any of the [feedback channels](feedback.md).

### Migrating from Visual Studio (sln) Runner
{id="migrating-to-net-from-sln"}

The [Visual Studio (sln)](visual-studio-sln.md) build runner is using the MSBuild engine under its hood and provides a few tweaks for the VS users to ease their experience with building projects in TeamCity. Since TeamCity 2019.2.3, the .NET runner is the recommended method for building projects with the MSBuild engine which makes it a migration option for the users of the Visual Studio (sln) step as well.

In general, to softly switch each existing Visual Studio (sln) build step to the .NET runner you need to:
1. Remember/copy the values of your Visual Studio (sln) runner's settings and command-line parameters.
2. Switch the Visual Studio (sln) build step to the .NET runner and select the `msbuild` command.
3. Fill in the fields according to the [`msbuild`](#msbuild) section.   
   Note that certain fields have different analogs in the .NET runner:
    * The MSBuild version should be specified instead of the version and platform of Visual Studio. See the [reference on versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSBuild#Versions).
    * Paths to solutions should be specified in the _Projects_ field.

Refer to the [respective section](#Migrating+from+MSBuild+Runner) for more information on migration to `msbuild`.

<note>

Note that TeamCity provides a new way to run Visual Studio projects. The .NET runner supports a full-featured implementation of the VS command-line mode with the `devenv` command ([read more](#Visual+Studio+Command-Line+Mode)).

</note>

### Migrating from Visual Studio Tests Runner

Since TeamCity 2019.2.3, the .NET runner is the recommended method for testing projects with VSTest instead of the [Visual Studio Tests](visual-studio-tests.md) runner. We have included the `vstest` command to our refactored .NET runner to ensure a long-term support of the .NET platform development strategy.

You can safely migrate existing Visual Studio Tests build steps to the .NET runner with the selected `vstest` command. Make sure to copy all additional command-line parameters and other important settings to the new runner. See the [`vstest`](#vstest) section for more details on the settings available in the .NET runner.

Additional features you will get in the .NET runner are:
* Support of cross-platform VSTest for .NET projects.
* Real-time test reporting by default.
* Support of ARM platform, along with x86 and x64.
* Ability to run and test the project inside a Docker container with our [](container-wrapper.md) extension.

Consider the following notes before migrating:
* The .NET runner supports the new [`.runsettings`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/configure-unit-tests-by-using-a-dot-runsettings-file) format of the VSTest settings file. However, it does not support the obsolete run configuration file format used in the Visual Studio Tests runner.
* Instead of the framework version, the .NET runner requests to specify the VSTest version.
* The .NET runner provides code coverage only for [dotCover](jetbrains-dotcover.md). If you are actively using NCover or PartCover in your MSBuild steps, please let us know about it via any of the [feedback channels](feedback.md).
* The .NET runner does not support the MSTest tool since all features of its framework are covered by VSTest. If you were using MSTest as the engine of the Visual Studio Tests runner, we suggest that you switch to VSTest when migrating to the .NET runner.


## Parallel Testing

If the .NET runner executes `test` or `vstest` commands, TeamCity can split the workload into several batches. In this case testing is carried out in separate automatically generated builds (on separate build agents). To enable this behavior, add the [](parallel-tests.md) build feature to the TeamCity build configuration.

<!--For large sets of .NET tests that can impair the performance, try switching to the [alternative filtering mode](parallel-tests.md#Alternative+Test+Filtering+for+.NET).-->

## .NET runner F.A.Q.

### How to pass parameters containing spaces

The best way to pass a parameter value containing space characters is to use [system properties](configuring-build-parameters.md#System+Properties). For example, you can add the `system.Platform` parameter with the `Any CPU` value in __Build Configuration Settings | Parameters__ and then refer to this value as `%\system.Platform%` inside the .NET step.

An alternative approach is to wrap the command-line parameter as follows: `"/p:Platform=Any CPU"`.
