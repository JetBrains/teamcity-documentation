[//]: # (title: Managing the Build Queue)

<show-structure for="chapter" depth="2"/>

The build queue holds builds waiting to be assigned to an available agent. The `teamcity queue` command group lets you inspect queued builds, control their priority, approve builds that require manual approval, and remove builds from the queue.

## Listing queued builds

View all builds currently in the queue:

```Shell
teamcity queue list
```

Filter by job:

```Shell
teamcity queue list --job MyProject_Build
```

Limit results and output as JSON:

```Shell
teamcity queue list --limit 20
teamcity queue list --json
teamcity queue list --json=id,state,buildType.name,triggered.user.name,webUrl
```

</table>

## Prioritizing a build

Move a queued build to the top of the queue, giving it the highest priority:

```Shell
teamcity queue top 12345
```

This is useful when a critical build needs to run before others in the queue.

## Approving a build

Some build configurations require manual approval before they can run. Approve a queued build:

```Shell
teamcity queue approve 12345
```

> Build approval is part of the TeamCity [deployment confirmation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/build-triggers.html) workflow. Builds requiring approval remain in the queue until approved or removed.

## Removing a build from the queue

Remove a build from the queue:

```Shell
teamcity queue remove 12345
```

Use `--force` to skip the confirmation prompt:

```Shell
teamcity queue remove 12345 --force
```
