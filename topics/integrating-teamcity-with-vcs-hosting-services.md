You can create presets of connections to the following hosting services:
* [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/)
* [GitLab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [GitLab CE/EE](https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/)
* [Bitbucket Cloud](https://bitbucket.org/)
* [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/)
* [JetBrains Space](https://www.jetbrains.com/space/)

Once created, such a connection can serve as a base for different operations: creating projects from URL, creating VCS roots, integrating with issue trackers, and authenticating users in TeamCity using their external profiles.

>In TeamCity Cloud, connections to GitHub.com, GitLab.com, and Bitbucket Cloud are already predefined in the Root project's settings, which makes them available in all the other projects.

Connections are configured on the __Project Administration | Connections__ page. Each connection is accessible in the current project and all its subprojects. If you use global VCS hosting services for your whole organization, it makes sense to configure a single connection to such a service on the Root project level. This way, the users will be able to quickly access the list of the organization's repositories when creating subprojects or editing projects' settings.

## Integrating TeamCity with GitHub

Integration with GitHub allows you to:
* create a [project from GitHub URL](creating-and-editing-projects.md#Creating+project+pointing+to+repository+URL)
* create a [VCS root from URL](guess-settings-from-repository-url.md)
* create a [Git VCS root](git.md)
* integrate with a [GitHub issue tracker](github.md)
* enable [GitHub authentication](configuring-authentication-settings.md#GitHub.com)

See how to configure a connection to GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise [here](configuring-connections.md#GitHub).
