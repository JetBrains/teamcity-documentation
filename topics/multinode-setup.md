[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Multinode Setup for High Availability;Multinode Setup)

The TeamCity server can be configured to use multiple nodes (or servers) for high availability and flexible load distribution. It is possible to set up a cluster of TeamCity nodes, where each node is responsible for different tasks, like processing data from builds or collecting changes from VCS repositories. Or, to keep one main node that does all the work and a secondary node which provides a read-only interface. In case the main node goes down, all data processing can be switched to the secondary node with minimum downtime.

As the main use case of a multinode setup is to achieve high availability (HA), this article will focus on configuring an HA cluster. However, you can use the same methods for any setup with multiple TeamCity nodes: for example, to distribute load between several machines.

## Main vs. secondary node

A TeamCity cluster can have one _main node_ and multiple _secondary nodes_. The main node is the "preferred" one. By default, it receives all incoming HTTP requests. It also performs critical background tasks, such as starting builds. A secondary node mostly serves as a backup server, necessary for the failover. For better load distribution and performance optimization, it can also be granted with [additional responsibilities](#Responsibilities).

## High-Availability Setup

### Prerequisites

A basic HA setup must include the following components:
* __Dedicated database server__: an external database server from the list of [supported databases](supported-platforms-and-environments.md#Databases).
* __Dedicated server for the TeamCity data directory__: the [data directory](#Shared+Data+Directory) should be shared with nodes by network, via NFS or SMB.
* __At least two servers for TeamCity nodes__ with the mounted [shared data directory](#Shared+Data+Directory): both servers should have the same or comparable hardware. Otherwise, if a secondary node is less performant, you can experience a significant performance drop in case of a failover.
* __Local storage on the TeamCity nodes__: necessary for the TeamCity installation and storing logs and local caches. To estimate the size of caches, see the size of the`<TeamCity data directory>/system/caches` directory in your current  installation.
* __Dedicated reverse HTTP proxy server__.

The minimum number of server machines necessary for a high-availability setup is 5: a database, a network storage server, two TeamCity nodes, and one server for the reverse HTTP proxy. A simpler load-balancing solution might be achieved with fewer machines.

>All nodes that use the same data directory share the same license key. If you own a TeamCity Enterprise license, no additional purchases are required.

### Shared Data Directory

The main TeamCity node and secondary nodes must be able to access and share the same [TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md).

Here are main recommendations on setting up the shared Data Directory:
* For a high-availability setup, store it on a separate and well-performing machine, so it is accessible even when the main node goes down.
* All TeamCity nodes’ machines should be able to access it in the read\/write modes.
* The typical Data Directory mounting options are SMB and NFS. TeamCity uses the Data Directory as a regular file system so all basic file system operations should be supported.
* The I/O operations count or I/O volume limits should not be restricted by the storage or mounting option.
* Make sure to review performance guidelines for your storage solution. For example, increasing MTU for the network connection between the server and the storage usually increases the artifact transfer speed.

#### Disable Network Client Caches on Data Directory Mounts

It is important that all the nodes "see" the current state of the shared Data Directory without delay. If this is not the case, it is likely to result in unstable behavior and frequent build log corruptions.

If TeamCity nodes run on Windows with Data Directory shared via SMB protocol, make sure all the registry keys mentioned in [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-7/ff686200(v=ws.10)) are set to 0 on all the TeamCity nodes.

If the Data Directory is shared via NFS, make sure all nodes have the following option in their mount settings: `lookupcache=positive`.

### Configuring HA Setup

This section relies on the following assumptions:
* All the [system requirements](system-requirements.md) are met.
* [TeamCity is installed](install-and-start-teamcity-server.md) on both nodes.
* [TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md) and database are already initialized.

Now, we can proceed with the transition from a single server setup to a high-availability cluster setup.

Used terms:
* [TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md) — a path to a mount point of the shared data directory.
* [TeamCity Home Directory](teamcity-home-directory.md) —  a path to the TeamCity server installation directory.
* Node-specific Data Directory —  a path to each node’s local storage where the node keeps its specific configuration and caches.
* `<node_ID>` — a unique identifier of a TeamCity node, which can be used in the UI and configuration files.
* `<node_root_URL>` — a direct URL of a node, usually `http://<node_hostname>`. This URL is required for inter-node communications; a firewall should be configured to allow connections to this URL from one node to another.

>Paths like `<TeamCity Data Directory>` or `<Node-specific data directory>` can be different on each node. To keep the setup simple, we recommend that you keep them the same.

To configure a TeamCity cluster consisting of two nodes, follow these steps:
1. Check that the version of the TeamCity server installed on both nodes is the same and corresponds to the version of the Data Directory.
2. Select an ID for each of the nodes: for example, a short ID based on a hostname.
3. Create the `TEAMCITY_SERVER_OPTS` environment variable on each node. This variable should have the following arguments:
    ```Shell
    -Dteamcity.server.nodeId=<node_ID> -Dteamcity.server.rootURL=<node_root_URL> -Dteamcity.data.path=<TeamCity Data Directory> -Dteamcity.node.data.path=<Node-specific Data Directory>
    ```
    >You can also specify a path to the shared TeamCity Data Directory via the `TEAMCITY_DATA_PATH` environment variable.  
    >Make sure the database is configured to accept enough parallel connections to handle requests from both nodes. By default, each node requires 50 connections to the database.
4. Start both nodes using [regular TeamCity scripts](start-teamcity-server.md) or via the TeamCity service.
5. Open the TeamCity __Administration | Nodes Configuration__ page on any of the two servers and enable the "_[Main TeamCity node](#Main+Node+Responsibility)_" responsibility for a node you want to make main.
6. Proceed with [configuring the reverse HTTP proxy](#Proxy+Configuration).

## Proxy Configuration

The reverse HTTP proxy serves as a single endpoint for TeamCity users and for [build agents](build-agent.md). This is also a good place to configure HTTPS connection settings for the entire cluster.

In case with TeamCity, the proxy server also acts as a load balancer for incoming requests. It can determine where the request should be sent and route it to the corresponding upstream server. In this article, we provide examples of the proxy configuration for two most popular proxy servers: NGINX and HAProxy.

In the examples above, the following values should be replaced:
* `{main_node_hostname}` — a hostname of the main node. If the UI of the main node operates on a port different from the proxy server port, this value should be specified in the form `hostname:port`.
* `{secondary_node_hostname}` — a hostname of the secondary node. If the secondary node operates on a port different from the proxy server port, this value should be specified in the form `hostname:port`
* `{main_node_id}` — the ID of the main node.
* `{secondary_node_id}` — the ID of the secondary node.
* `{proxy_server_hostname}` — proxy server name (NGINX only).

On a failover, if a former secondary node is assigned with the _Main TeamCity node_ responsibility, the configuration of the main and secondary nodes in the proxy config should be updated: `{main_node_hostname}` and `{main_node_id}` should be replaced with the hostname and ID of the new main node; `{secondary_node_hostname}` and `{secondary_node_id}` — with the hostname and ID of the former main node.

>Since users will be using the URL of the proxy server for accessing the TeamCity UI, this URL should be specified as a "Server URL" on the __Administration | Global Settings__ page. Likewise, as build agents will be using it for accessing the nodes, it should be set as `serverUrl` in the [build agents' configs](configure-agent-installation.md).
> 
{type="note"}

The proxy config sets a special header `X-TeamCity-Proxy`. It tells TeamCity that a request comes through a properly configured proxy. The header also defines a version of the proxy config: it helps ensure that the TeamCity server is compatible with the proxy configuration.

### Domain Isolation Proxy Configuration

The [domain isolation](teamcity-configuration-and-maintenance.md#artifacts-domain-isolation) mode requires configuring a dedicated domain for serving artifacts. Make sure to add a new record in your DNS pointing from this domain to the proxy address: for example, it could be a `CNAME` record pointing to the proxy URL.

## Failover

In the case of a failover, when the main node is no longer available either because of a crash or during maintenance, a secondary node can be granted with the "_Main TeamCity node_" responsibility and act as a main node temporarily or permanently.

Each secondary node tracks the activity of the current main node and, if it is inactive for several minutes (3 by default), shows the corresponding health report. After you see this report, you can assign the "_Main TeamCity Node_" responsibility to another node. However, if this inactivity has not been planned (that is, the main node has crashed), it is important to verify that no TeamCity server processes are left running on the inactive node. If you detect such processes, you need to stop them before reassigning the "_Main TeamCity node_" responsibility.

After switching the responsibility, you also need to update the IDs and hostnames of nodes in the [reverse proxy configuration](#Proxy+Configuration) and reload the proxy server configuration. Otherwise, if you decide to start the former main node again, the proxy won’t be able to properly route agents and users.

To sum up, on a failover, follow these steps:
1. Wait for a server health report about the main node unavailability on the secondary node.
2. Make sure the main node is stopped.
3. Switch the "Main node" responsibility on the secondary node.
4. Update the main node ID in the reverse proxy configuration and reload the config.

## Nodes Configuration and Usage

### Authentication and License

The main and secondary nodes operate under the same license.

Secondary nodes use the same authentication settings as the main node. However, users might be asked to relog in after they are routed to a secondary node. This happens in two cases: (1) a user did not select the "Remember Me" option on the login screen and (2) [SSO authentication](configuring-authentication-settings.md) is not configured.

### Global Settings

Secondary notes use the same global settings (path to artifacts, version control settings, and so on) as the main node.

### Responsibilities

By default, a newly started secondary node provides a read-only user interface and does not perform any background activity. You can assign the following additional responsibilities to each secondary node in __Administration | Server Administration | Nodes Configuration__:

* [Processing data produced by builds](#Processing+Data+Produced+by+Builds+on+Secondary+Node)
* [VCS repositories polling](#VCS+Repositories+Polling+on+Secondary+Node)
* [Processing build triggers](#Processing+Triggers+on+Secondary+Node)
* [Processing user requests to modify data](#Processing+User+Requests+to+Modify+Data+on+Secondary+Node)
* [Main TeamCity node](#Main+Node+Responsibility)

A node assigned to any responsibility will allow users to perform the [most common actions](#User-level+Actions+on+Secondary+Node) on builds.

You can enable and disable responsibilities for nodes at any moment.

#### Processing Data Produced by Builds on Secondary Node

It is possible to use one or more secondary nodes to process traffic from the TeamCity agents. This allows moving the related load to a separate machine from the main TeamCity node which will improve the TeamCity performance when handling hundreds of concurrent and actively logging builds.

In general, you do not need a separate node for running builds unless you have more than 400 agents connected to a single node. Using a secondary node allows you to significantly increase the number of agents which the setup can handle.

Once you assign a secondary node to the _Processing data produced by builds_ responsibility for the first time, all\* newly started builds will be routed to this node. The existing running builds will continue being executed on the main node. When you disable the responsibility, only the newly started builds will be switched to the main node. The builds that were already running on the secondary node will continue running there.  
If you assign more than one secondary nodes to this responsibility, builds will be distributed equally between these nodes.

\* You can control how many builds can be run by each node.  
To do this, find the required node in the list of available nodes and click __Edit__  next to its _Processing data produced by running builds_ responsibility. The _Limit builds_ dialog will open. Here, you can enter a relative limit of builds allowed to run on this node. We suggest that you choose this limit depending on the node's hardware capabilities.  
If the maximum limit of allowed running builds is reached on all secondary nodes, TeamCity will be running new builds on the main node until some secondary node finishes its build.

#### VCS Repositories Polling on Secondary Node

Usually, the main TeamCity node polls the VCS repositories for changes to detect new commits. You can delegate VCS polling to the secondary node thus improving the performance of the main node. Only one secondary node can be assigned to this responsibility.

Once you assign the _VCS repositories polling_ responsibility to a node, it may take some time for the main node to finish the polling activities in progress, and then the secondary node will pick up this task. When you disable the responsibility, the main node will start polling VCS repositories. This responsibility can be assigned only to one node in a cluster.

If you have commit hooks configured on the main node, no changes in hooks are required: the hooks will continue working if the VCS polling is delegated to the secondary node.

#### Processing Triggers on Secondary Node

In setups with many build agents, a significant amount of the main node's CPU is allocated to constant processing of build triggers. By enabling the _Processing build trigger_ responsibility for one or more secondary nodes, you can distribute the trigger processing tasks and CPU load between the main node and the responsible secondary ones. TeamCity distributes the triggers automatically but you can see what triggers are currently assigned to each node.

#### Processing User Requests to Modify Data on Secondary Node

This responsibility is responsible for allowing [user actions on a secondary node](#User-level+Actions+on+Secondary+Node). It is especially useful when the main node is down or goes through maintenance.

#### Main Node Responsibility

You can assign a secondary node to the _Main TeamCity node_ responsibility. This responsibility by default belongs to the current main node, but gets vacant if this node becomes unavailable. After you assign any secondary node to this responsibility, it becomes the main node and receives all its other responsibilities (processing builds, managing agents, and so on). All the running builds will continue their operations without interruption. If a [proxy is configured](#Proxy+Configuration) in your setup, build agents will seamlessly reconnect to the new main node.  
When the previous main node starts again, it becomes a secondary node, as the _Main TeamCity node_ responsibility is already occupied by another node. If necessary, you can repeat the procedure above to switch roles between these nodes.

### Internal Properties

All TeamCity nodes rely both on common internal properties, stored in the [shared data directory](#Shared+Data+Directory), and specific properties, stored in the node-specific data directory. The node-specific properties have a higher priority and overwrite the common values in case of a conflict.

To disable any common property on a given secondary node, pass it using the following syntax: `-<property_name>`.

### Secondary Node Memory Settings

The secondary node requires the same memory settings as the main node. If you have already configured the `TEAMCITY_SERVER_MEM_OPTS` [environment variable](server-startup-properties.md) for the main node, make sure to use the same variable for the secondary node. If your main node uses a 64-bit JVM, the secondary node must use a 64-bit JVM as well.

### Project Import

You can import projects to the main node only. Secondary nodes will detect the imported data in the runtime, without restarting.

### Using Plugins

A secondary node has access to all plugins enabled on the main node. It also watches for the newly uploaded plugins. If a secondary node detects that a plugin has been uploaded to the main node, it will show the respective notification on its __Administration | Plugins__ page. If the plugin supports it, it can be reloaded in runtime with no need to restart the secondary node — the respective hint will be displayed in the UI.

A number of bundled plugins can be used on the main node only:
* Jira Cloud integration
* Kubernetes support
* Install Agent on a remote host (agent push)
* WebHooks support

>Secondary nodes can load an external/non-bundled plugin if this plugin supports secondary nodes. See the [Plugins F.A.Q.](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/teamcity/plugin-development-faq.html#How+to+adapt+plugin+for+secondary+node) for details.

{type="note"}

### Clean-up

The TeamCity clean-up task runs on the main node only. In a multinode configuration, as well as in a single node configuration, the task can run while the secondary nodes are handling their operations.

### Installing Additional Secondary Node

To install a secondary node, follow these steps on the secondary node machine:

1. [Install](install-and-start-teamcity-server.md) the TeamCity software as usual: download the distribution package and follow the installation wizard. Please note: when installing a secondary node using the installation wizard, it is important not to start the TeamCity Server service until the environment variables in step 2 and 3 are configured.
2. Provide the path to the [shared Data Directory](#Shared+Data+Directory) via the `TEAMCITY_DATA_PATH` [environment variable](server-startup-properties.md#JVM+Options).
3. Add additional arguments to the `TEAMCITY_SERVER_OPTS` environment variable:
    ```Plain Text
    TEAMCITY_SERVER_OPTS = -Dteamcity.server.nodeId=<node_ID> -Dteamcity.node.data.path=<path_to_node_data_directory>  -Dteamcity.server.rootURL=<node_URL>
    
    ```
   where
   * `<node_ID>` is the ID of the node that will be displayed on the __Administration | Nodes Configuration__ page.
   * `<path_to_node_data_directory>` is the path to the node Data Directory.
   * `<node_URL>` is the secondary node root URL. It should be accessible from the main node and agents.

### Upgrade/Downgrade

It is recommended that the main TeamCity node and all secondary nodes have the same version. In certain cases, the main node and secondary nodes can be running different versions for a short period, for example, during the minor upgrade of the main node. When the versions of a secondary node and the main node are different, the corresponding health report will be displayed on both nodes.

When __upgrading to a minor version__ (a bugfix release), the main and the secondary nodes should be running without issues as the TeamCity data format stays the same. You can upgrade the main TeamCity node and then the secondary nodes [manually](upgrading-teamcity-server-and-agents.md), or with the [automatic update](upgrading-teamcity-server-and-agents.md#Automatic+Update).

When __upgrading the main node to a major version__, its TeamCity data format will change. We recommend stopping all the secondary nodes before starting the upgrade of the main node to avoid any possible data format errors.   
To be able to process tasks, all secondary nodes must be upgraded after the main node major upgrade.

To __upgrade__ nodes in a multinode setup to a major version of TeamCity, follow these steps:
1. Stop all secondary nodes.
2. Start the [upgrade](upgrading-teamcity-server-and-agents.md) on the main TeamCity node as usual.
3. Proceed with the upgrade.
4. Verify that everything works properly and agents are connecting to the main node (the agents will reroute the data that was supposed to be routed to the secondary nodes to the main node).
5. Upgrade TeamCity on the secondary nodes to the same version.
6. Start the secondary nodes and verify that they are connected on the __Administration | Server Administration | Nodes Configuration__ page on the main node.

To __downgrade__ nodes in a multinode setup, follow these steps:
1. Shutdown the main node and the secondary nodes.
2. [Restore the data](restoring-teamcity-data-from-backup.md) from backup (only if the data format has been changed during the upgrade).
3. Downgrade the TeamCity software on the main node.
4. Start the main TeamCity node and verify that everything works properly.
5. Downgrade the TeamCity software on the secondary nodes to the same version as the main node.
6. Start the secondary nodes.

TeamCity agents will perform upgrade/downgrade automatically.

### Start/Stop

Any TeamCity node can be started/stopped using regular TeamCity scripts (`teamcity-server.bat` or `teamcity-server.sh`) or Windows services. The environment variables [`TEAMCITY_DATA_PATH`], [`TEAMCITY_SERVER_MEM_OPTS`], and [`TEAMCITY_SERVER_OPTS`] are supported by all types of nodes.

All nodes use the same approach to logging events. You can check the state of the startup in the `<TeamCity Home Directory>/logs/teamcity-server.log` file. Or, you can open `<node root URL>` in your browser to see the TeamCity startup screens.

A secondary node, as well as the main node, can be stopped or restarted while the builds are running. They will continue running on agents and either will be reassigned to another node by the proxy, or will wait until their appointed node starts again.

### Backup/Restore

You can back up the main node right [from the TeamCity UI](creating-backup-from-teamcity-web-ui.md). [From a command line](creating-backup-via-maintaindb-command-line-tool.md), you can back up both the main node and secondary nodes.

The restore operation can be done on either of the nodes, but only if all nodes using the TeamCity database and data directory are stopped.

>Currently, the contents of the `<Node-specific data directory>` are not included in the backup.

### User-level Actions on Secondary Node

If the "_[Processing user requests to modify data](#Processing+User+Requests+to+Modify+Data+on+Secondary+Node)_" responsibility is enabled on a secondary node, it will allow performing the most common user-level actions:
* Triggering a build, including a custom or personal one
* Stopping/deleting and pinning/tagging/commenting builds
* Pausing/resuming the build queue
* Assigning investigations and muting build problems and tests
* Marking a build as successful/failed
* Editing build changes\' descriptions
* Merging sources and labeling sources actions
* Adding builds to favorites
* Changing settings of user profiles, including general settings, groups and roles, access tokens, VCS usernames, and notification rules
* Reordering and hiding projects and build configurations
* Checking for pending changes
* Agent-related actions (see the [list of actions](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-65199))
* Editing projects and build configurations

See the related tasks in our issue tracker for the full list of available actions: [TW-62749](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-62749), [TW-63346](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-63346).

Administrator-level actions are not yet available on secondary nodes. Use the main node if you need to change the node configuration.

## Multinode Setup Health Reports

See the related reports in the [dedicated article](server-health.md#Multinode+Setup+Misconfiguration).

## Common Issues

### Trouble Accessing Data Directory from Windows Service

Note that if TeamCity is running as a service on Windows, it might not be able to access the TeamCity Data Directory via a mapped network drive. This happens because Windows services cannot work with mapped network drives, and TeamCity does not support the UNC format (`\\host\directory`) for the Data Directory path. To work around this problem, you can use [`mklink`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mklink) as it allows making a symbolic link on a network drive:

```Console

mklink /d "C:\<path to mount point>" "\\<host>\<shared directory name>\"

```

Make sure remote-to-local symbolic link evaluations are enabled in your OS:

```Console

fsutil behavior query SymlinkEvaluation

```

To enable them, use the following command:

```Console

fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2L:1

```
