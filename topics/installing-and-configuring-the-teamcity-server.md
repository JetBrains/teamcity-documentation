This page covers a new TeamCity server installation. For __upgrade instructions__, refer to [Upgrade](upgrade.md).

To install a TeamCity server, perform the following:

1. Choose the appropriate TeamCity distribution (`.exe`, `.tar.gz` or [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jetbrains/teamcity-server/)) based on the details below. You can also [run TeamCity on AWS](running-teamcity-stack-in-aws.md) stack.
2. [Download](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/) the distribution.
3. Review [software requirements](supported-platforms-and-environments.md) and [hardware requirements notes](how-to.md#Estimate+Hardware+Requirements+for+TeamCity) and [platform selection](how-to.md#Choose+OS%2FPlatform+for+TeamCity+Server).
4. Review TeamCity [Licensing Policy](licensing-policy.md).
5. Install and configure the TeamCity server per instructions below.

## Installing TeamCity Server

After you have selected one of the [TeamCity installation options](installation.md#Select+TeamCity+Installation+Package), proceed with corresponding installation instructions:

* [Windows .exe distribution](#Installing+TeamCity+via+Windows+installation+package) – the executable which provides the installation wizard for Windows platforms and allows installing the server as a Windows service.
* [.tar.gz distribution](#Installing+TeamCity+bundled+with+Tomcat+servlet+container+%28Linux%2C+macOS%2C+Windows%29) – the archive with a "portable" version suitable for all platforms.
* Docker image – check the instructions at the [image page](https://hub.docker.com/r/jetbrains/teamcity-server/).

The `.exe` and `.tar.gz` distributions:
* Include a Tomcat version which TeamCity is tested with, so it is known to be a working combination. This might not be the case with an external Tomcat.
* Define additional JRE options which are usually recommended for running the server.
* Have the [teamcity-server startup script](#Starting+TeamCity+server) which provides several convenience options (for example, separate environment variable for memory settings) and configures TeamCity correctly (for example, `.log4j` configuration).
* At least under Windows, provide better error reporting for some cases (like a missing Java installation).
* Under Windows, allow running TeamCity as a service with the ability to use the same configuration as if run from the console.
* Come bundled with a build agent distribution and single startup script which allows for easy TeamCity server evaluation with one agent.
* Come bundled with the devPackage for [TeamCity plugin development](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD18/Developing+TeamCity+Plugins).
* May provide more convenience features in the future.

After installation, the TeamCity web UI can be accessed via a web browser. The default addresses are [`http://localhost/`](http://localhost/) for Windows distribution and [`http://localhost:8111/`](http://localhost:8111/) for the `tar.gz` distribution.

If you cannot access the TeamCity web UI after successful installation, please refer to the [Troubleshooting TeamCity Installation](#Troubleshooting+TeamCity+Installation) section.

The build server and one build agent will be installed by default for Windows, Linux or macOS. If you need more build agents, refer to the [Installing Additional Build Agents](setting-up-and-running-additional-build-agents.md) section.

<warning>

During the server setup you can select either an internal database or an existing external database. By default, TeamCity uses an HSQLDB database that does not require configuring. This database suites the purposes of testing and evaluating the system. For [production purposes](#Configuring+Server+for+Production+Use), using a standalone external database is recommended.
</warning>

### Installing TeamCity via Windows installation package

For the Windows platform, run the executable file and follow the installation instructions. You have options to install the TeamCity web server and one build agent that can be run as a Windows service.

If you opted to install the services, use the standard Windows `Services` applet to manage the service. Otherwise, use standard [scripts](#Starting+TeamCity+server).

If you did not change the default port (80) during the installation, the TeamCity web UI can be accessed via [`http://localhost/`](http://localhost/) in a web browser running on the same machine where the server is installed. Note that port 80 can be used by other programs (for example, Skype, or other web servers like IIS). In this case you can specify another port during the installation and use [`http://localhost:<port>/`](http://localhost:<port>/) address in the browser.

If you want to edit the TeamCity server's service parameters, memory settings or system properties after the installation, refer to the [Configuring TeamCity Server Startup Properties](configuring-teamcity-server-startup-properties.md) page.

<warning>

Make sure the user account specified for the service has:
* log on as service right ([related Microsoft page](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc794944%28v=ws.10%29.aspx))
* write permissions for the [TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md)
* write permissions for the [TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md), that is directory where TeamCity was installed
* all the necessary permissions to work with the external systems like version controls

By default, the Windows service is installed under the SYSTEM account. To change it, use the Services applet (__Control Panel | Administrative Tools | Services__).

</warning>

### Installing TeamCity bundled with Tomcat servlet container (Linux, macOS, Windows)

Review [software requirements](supported-platforms-and-environments.md#TeamCity+Server) before the installation.

<tip>

We recommend running the TeamCity server under a dedicated user account.

</tip>

Unpack the `TeamCity<version number>.tar.gz` archive (for example, using the `tar xfz TeamCity<version number>.tar.gz` command under Linux, or the WinZip, WinRar or similar utility under Windows). Use GNU tar to unpack (for example, Solaris 10 tar is reported to truncate too long file names and may cause a `ClassNotFoundException` when using the server after such unpacking. Consider getting GNU tar at [Solaris packages](http://sunfreeware.com/) or using the `gtar xfz` command).

Ensure you have JRE or JDK installed and the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is pointing to the Java installation directory. Java JDK 1.8.0_161 or later is required.

### Unattended TeamCity server installation

For automated server installation, use the `.tar.gz` distribution.

Typically, you will need to unpack it and make the script perform the steps noted in the [Configuring Server for Production Use](#Configuring+Server+for+Production+Use) section.

If you want to get a preconfigured server right away, put files from a previously configured server into the Data Directory. For each new server you will need to ensure it points to a new database (configured in `<Data Directory>\config\database.properties`) and change `<Data Directory>\config\main-config.xml` file not to have the `uuid` attribute in the root XML element (so new one can be generated) and setting appropriate value for "rootURL" attribute.

### Using another Version of Tomcat

To use another version of the Tomcat web server instead of the one bundled in the `.tar.gz` and `.exe` distributions), you can perform the Tomcat upgrade/patch. 

For the latter, you might want to:
* Backup the current [TeamCity home](teamcity-home-directory.md).
* Delete/move out the directories from the [TeamCity home](teamcity-home-directory.md) which are also present in the Tomcat distribution.
* Unpack the Tomcat distribution into the [TeamCity home directory](teamcity-home-directory.md).
* Copy TeamCity-specific files from the previously backed-up/moved directories to the [TeamCity home](teamcity-home-directory.md). Namely:
  * files under `bin` which are not present in the Tomcat distribution
  * review differences between the default Tomcat `conf` directory and one from TeamCity, update Tomcat files with TeamCity-specific settings (teamcity-* files, and portions of `server.xml`)
  * delete the default Tomcat `webapps/ROOT` directory and replace it with the one provided by TeamCity

## Starting TeamCity server

Under Windows, if TeamCity server is installed as a Windows service, follow the usual procedure of starting and stopping services.

If TeamCity is installed using the `.exe` or `.tar.gz` distributions, the TeamCity server can be started and stopped by the `teamcity-server` scripts provided in the \<[TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md)\>\/bin directory. The script accepts `run` (run in the same console), `start` (start new detached process and exit from the script), and `stop` commands.

* __(evaluation only) To start/stop the TeamCity server and one default agent at the same time__, use the `runAll` script, for example:
   * Use `runAll.bat start` to start the server and the default agent
   * Use `runAll.bat stop` to stop the server and the default agent
  
* __To start/stop the TeamCity server only__, use the `teamcity-server` scripts and pass the required parameters. Start the script without parameters to see the usage instructions. The `teamcity-server` scripts support the following options for the `stop` command:
   * `stop n` – sends the stop command to the TeamCity server and waits up to n seconds for the process to end.
   * `stop n -force` – sends the stop command to the TeamCity server, waits up to n seconds for the process to end, and terminates the server process if it did not stop.

<tip>
The TeamCity server will restart automatically if the server process exits (crashes or is killed) without invoking `teamcity-server stop` script.
</tip>

By default, TeamCity runs on [`http://localhost:8111/`](http://localhost:8111/). See the information [below](#Changing+Server+Port) for changing the server port.

If you need to pass special properties to the server, refer to [Configuring TeamCity Server Startup Properties](configuring-teamcity-server-startup-properties.md).

### Autostart TeamCity server on macOS

Starting up TeamCity server on macOS is quite similar to starting Tomcat on macOS.

1. Install TeamCity and make sure it works if started from the command line with `bin/teamcity-server.sh start`. We'll assume that TeamCity is installed in the /Library/TeamCity folder
2. Create the `/Library/LaunchDaemons/jetbrains.teamcity.server.plist` file with the following content:   
    ```XML
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
        <string>/Library/TeamCity</string>
        <key>Debug</key>
        <false/>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>jetbrains.teamcity.server</string>
        <key>OnDemand</key>
        <false/>
        <key>KeepAlive</key>
        <true/>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
            <string>/bin/bash</string>
            <string>--login</string>
            <string>-c</string>
            <string>bin/teamcity\-server.sh run</string>
        </array>
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true/>
        <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
        <string>logs/launchd.err.log</string>
        <key>StandardOutPath</key>
        <string>logs/launchd.out.log</string>
    </dict>
    </plist>
    
    ```
3. Test your file by running this command:     
    ```Shell
    launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/jetbrains.teamcity.server.plist
    
    ```
    This command should start the TeamCity server (you can see this from `logs/teamcity-server.log` and in your browser). 
4. If you don't want TeamCity to start under the root permissions, specify the __UserName__ key in the `.plist` file, for example:   
    ```XML
    <key>UserName</key>
    <string>teamcity_user</string>
    
    ```
The TeamCity server will now start automatically when the machine starts. To configure automatic start of a TeamCity Build Agent, see the [dedicated section](setting-up-and-running-additional-build-agents.md#Automatic+Start).

## Installation Configuration

### Troubleshooting TeamCity Installation

Upon successful installation, the TeamCity server web UI can be accessed via a web browser. The default address that can be used to access TeamCity from the same machine depends on the installation package and installation options. (Port 80 is used for Windows installation, unless another port is specified, port 8111 for `.tar.gz` installation unless not changed in the server configuration).

If the TeamCity web UI cannot be accessed, check the following:
* the "TeamCity Server" service is running (if you installed TeamCity as a Windows service)
* the TeamCity server process (Tomcat) is running (it is a `java` process run in the \<[TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md)\>\/bin directory)
* the console output if you run the server from a console
* the `teamcity-server.log` and other files in the \<[TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md)\>\logs directory for error messages

One of the most common issues with the server installation is using a port that is already used by another program. See [below](#Changing+Server+Port) on changing the default port.

### Changing Server Port

If you use the TeamCity server Windows installer, you can set the port to be used during installation.

Use the following instructions to change the port if you use the `.tar.gz` distribution. If another application uses the same port as the TeamCity server, the TeamCity server (Tomcat server) won't start and this will be identified by "Address already in use" errors in the server logs or server console.

To change the server port, in the \<[TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md)\>/conf/server.xml file, change the port number in the not commented `<Connector>` XML node (here the port number is 8111):


```XML
<Connector port="8111" ...

```

To apply the changes, restart the server. If the server was working with the old port previously, you would need to change the port in all the stored URLs of the server (browser bookmarks, agents' `serverUrl` [property](build-agent-configuration.md), URL in user's IDEs, the _Server URL_ setting on the __Administration | Global Settings__ page).

If you run another Tomcat server on the same machine, you might need to also change other Tomcat server service ports (search for `port=` in the `server.xml` file).

If you want to use the `https://` protocol, it should be enabled separately and the process is not specific to TeamCity, but rather for the web server used (Tomcat by default). See also [Configure HTTPS for TeamCity Web UI](how-to.md#Configure+HTTPS+for+TeamCity+Web+UI).

### Changing Server Context

By default, the TeamCity server is accessible under the root context of the server address (for example, [`http://localhost:8111/`](http://localhost:8111/) ). To make it available under a nested path instead (for example, [`http://localhost:8111/teamcity/`](http://localhost:8111/teamcity/) ), you need to:

1. Stop the TeamCity server.
2. Rename the \<[TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md)\>\webapps\ROOT directory to \<[TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md)\>\webapps\teamcity.
3. Start the TeamCity server.

<tip>

Note that after this change [automatic update](upgrade.md#Automatic+Update) will be disabled for your installation and you will have to upgrade TeamCity [manually](upgrade.md#Manual+Upgrade).
</tip>


### Java Installation

The TeamCity server is a JVM web application that runs in Tomcat application server. TeamCity server requires a Java SE JRE installation to run. Compatible JRE is bundled in TeamCity Windows installer but needs to be installed separately when using other distributions.

It is recommended to run TeamCity server with the latest Java 11 x64. The recommended Java distribution is [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/).   
Supported Java versions are OpenJDK and Oracle Java 8 (8u16 or later) and 11 (32 or 64 bit).

If you have configured any native libraries for use with TeamCity (like `.dll` for using the Integrated Security option of the Microsoft SQL database), you need to update the libraries to match the JVM x86/x64 platform.

TeamCity selects the Java to run the server process as follows:
* By default, if your TeamCity installation has a bundled JRE (the \<[TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md)\>\jre directory exists), it will be used to run the TeamCity server process. To use a different JRE, specify its path via the `TEAMCITY_JRE` environment variable.
* If there is no \<[TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md)\>\jre directory present, TeamCity looks for the `JRE_HOME` or `JAVA_HOME` environment variable pointing to the installation directory of JRE or JVM (Java SDK) respectively. If both variables are declared, JRE will be used.

The necessary steps to update the Java installation depend on the distribution used.
* If your TeamCity installation has a bundled JRE (there is the \<[TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md)\>\jre directory), update it by installing a newer JRE per installation instructions and copying the content of the resulting directory to replace the content of the existing \<[TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md)\>\jre directory.   
If you also run a TeamCity agent from the \<[TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md)\>\buildAgent directory, install JDK (Java SDK) installation instead of JRE and copy content of JDK installation directory into \<[TeamCity Home](teamcity-home-directory.md)\>\jre.

[//]: # (Internal note. Do not delete. "Installing and Configuring the TeamCity Serverd172e906.txt")

>If you use a different Java version, specified via an environment variable (`TEAMCITY_JRE`, `JRE_HOME`, or `JAVA_HOME`), make sure it is available for the process launching the TeamCity server (it is recommended to set a global OS environment variable and restart the system). The variable should point to the home directory of the installed JRE or JVM (Java SDK) respectively.

### Using 64 bit Java to Run TeamCity Server

TeamCity server is bundled with the 64-bit JVM but can run under both the 32- and 64-bit Java.

If you need to update 32-bit Java to the 64-bit JVM, note that the memory usage is almost doubled when switching from the 32- to 64-bit JVM, so make sure you specify at least twice as much memory as for 32-bit JVM, see [Setting Up Memory settings for TeamCity Server](#Setting+Up+Memory+settings+for+TeamCity+Server).

To update to the 64-bit Java, either use the bundled version of Java or:
* [Update](#Java+Installation) Java to be used by the server.
* [Set JVM memory options](configuring-teamcity-server-startup-properties.md). It is recommended to set the following options for the 64-bit JVM: `-Xmx4g -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=450m`.

<anchor name="InstallingandConfiguringtheTeamCityServer-SettingUpMemorysettingsforTeamCityServer"/>

### Setting Up Memory settings for TeamCity Server

TeamCity server has the main process which can also launch child processes. Child processes use available memory on the machine, this section covers the memory settings of the main TeamCity server process only as it requires special configuration.   
As a JVM application, the TeamCity main server process only utilizes memory devoted to the JVM. The required memory may depend on the JVM used (32- or 64-bit). The memory used by JVM usually consists of: heap (configured via `-Xmx`) and metaspace (limited by the amount of available native memory), internal JVM (usually tens of Mb), and OS-dependent memory features like memory-mapped files. TeamCity mostly depends on the heap memory, and this setting can be configured for the TeamCity application manually by [passing](configuring-teamcity-server-startup-properties.md#JVM+Options) the `-Xmx` (heap space) option to the JVM running the TeamCity server.

Once you start using TeamCity for [production](#Configuring+Server+for+Production+Use) purposes or if you want to load the server during evaluation, you should manually set the appropriate memory settings for the TeamCity server.

To __change the memory settings__, refer to [Configuring TeamCity Server Startup Properties](configuring-teamcity-server-startup-properties.md#JVM+Options).   
Generally this means setting `TEAMCITY_SERVER_MEM_OPTS` environment variable to the value like `-Xmx750m`

We recommend removing the `-XX:MaxPermSize` JVM option from the `TEAMCITY_SERVER_MEM_OPTS` environment variable, if previously configured, since it is ignored in Java 8.

If slowness, OutOfMemory errors occur, or you consistently see a memory-related warning in the TeamCity UI, increase the setting to the next level.
* __minimum setting__: for 32-bit Java `-Xmx750m `, for 64-bit Java (bundled) `-Xmx1024m`
* __recommended setting__ for __medium__ server use: for 32-bit Java `-Xmx1024m`. Greater settings with the 32-bit Java can cause an `OutOfMemoryError` with "Native memory allocation (malloc) failed" JVM crashes or "Unable to create new native thread" messages. For 64-bit Java `-Xmx2048m`.
* __recommended setting__ for __large__ server use (64-bit Java should be used): `-Xmx4g -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=450m`.  These settings should be suitable for an installation with up to two hundreds of agents and thousands of build configurations. Custom plugins installed might require increasing the value defined via the `Xmx` parameter.
* __maximum settings__ for large-scale server use (64-bit Java should be used): `-Xmx10g -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=640m`. Greater values can be used for larger TeamCity installations. However, generally it is not recommended to use values greater than `10g` without consulting TeamCity support.

__Tips__:
* the 32-bit JVM can reliably work with up to 1Gb heap memory (`Xmx1024m`). (This can be increased to `-Xmx1200m`, but JVM under Windows might crash occasionally with this setting.) If more memory is necessary, the 64-bit JVM should be used with not less than 2Gb assigned (`-Xmx2048m`). Unless the TeamCity server runs with more than 100 agents or serves very active builds / thousands of users, it's unlikely that you will need to dedicate more than 4Gb of memory to the TeamCity process.
* A rule of thumb is that the 64-bit JVM should be assigned twice as much memory as the 32-bit for the same application. If you switch to the 64-bit JVM (for example, on upgrading to TeamCity 2020.1 via the Windows installer), make sure you adjust the memory setting (`-Xmx`) accordingly. It does not make sense to switch to 64-bit if you dedicate less than the double amount of memory to the application.
* Large TeamCity installations might benefit from fine-tuning of the memory settings. The amount of memory dedicated to TeamCity server JVM should not regularly exceed 60% of the total available physical memory on the machine (to allow for nested process and OS-level caches usage). Also, with heaps (`–Xmx`) set to more than 8Gb, if the machine has many CPU cores (for example, more than 8) and current CPU usage is below 60%, enabling G1 JVM garbage collector via the `-XX:+UseG1GC` JVM option might reduce the length of stop-the-world GC pauses.

The recommended approach is to start with initial settings and monitor for the percentage of used memory using the __Administration | Diagnostics__ page. If the server uses more than 80% of memory consistently without drops for tens of minutes, that is probably a sign to increase the `-Xmx` memory value by another 20%.

## Configuring TeamCity Server

<note>

* If you have a lot of projects or build configurations, we recommend you avoid using the __Default agent__ in order to free up the TeamCity server resources. The TeamCity Administrator can [disable](build-agents-configuration-and-maintenance.md#Enabling%2FDisabling+Agents+via+UI) the default agent on the __Agents__ page of the web UI.
* When changing the TeamCity Data Directory or database, make sure they do not get out of sync.
</note>

### Configuring TeamCity Data Directory

The default placement of the TeamCity Data Directory can be changed. See [TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md) for details.

### Editing Server Configuration

After successful server start, any TeamCity page request will redirect to prompt for the server administrator username and password. Make sure no one can access the server pages until the administrator account is setup.

After administration account setup you may begin to create Project and Build Configurations in the TeamCity server. You may also want to configure the following settings in the Server Administration section:
* Server URL
* Email server address and settings
* Jabber server address and settings

### Configuring Server for Production Use

Out-of-the-box TeamCity server installation is suitable for evaluation purposes. For production use you will need to perform additional configuration which typically includes:
* Check that the server is using due [server port](#Changing+Server+Port) and configure [access via https](how-to.md#Configure+HTTPS+for+TeamCity+Web+UI).
* Make sure server URL, email and (optionally) Jabber server settings are specified and are correct.
* Configuring the server process for OS-dependent autostart on machine reboot.
* Using reliable storage for [TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md).
* [Using external database](setting-up-an-external-database.md).
* [Configuring recommended memory settings](#Setting+Up+Memory+settings+for+TeamCity+Server), use "maximum settings" for active or growing servers.
* Planning for regular [backups](teamcity-data-backup.md).
* Planning for regular [upgrades](upgrade.md) to the latest TeamCity releases.
* (since TeamCity 10.0.3) Consider adding the `teamcity.installation.completed=true` line into the \<[TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md)\>\conf\teamcity-startup.properties file – this will prevent the server from creating an administrator user if no such user is found.

Make sure to review the [notes on configuring the server for performance](how-to.md#Configuring+TeamCity+Server+for+Performance) and [security notes](security-notes.md).
