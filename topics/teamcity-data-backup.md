[//]: # (title: TeamCity Data Backup)
[//]: # (auxiliary-id: TeamCity Data Backup)

TeamCity provides several ways to back up its data:
* [Backup from the Web UI](creating-backup-from-teamcity-web-ui.md): an action in the web UI (can also be triggered via [REST API](rest-api.md#Data+Backup)) to create a backup while the server is running. It is recommended for regular maintenance backups. Some limitations on the backed up data apply (see the [related section](#Backing+up+Data) below). This option is also available on upgrade in the maintenance screen: on the first start of a newer version of the TeamCity server.
* [Backup via maintainDB command-line tool](creating-backup-via-maintaindb-command-line-tool.md): same as via the UI. To include all data, use the tool when the server [is stopped](creating-backup-via-maintaindb-command-line-tool.md#Performing+TeamCity+Data+Backup+with+maintainDB+Utility).
* [Manual backup](manual-backup-and-restore.md): is suitable if you want to manage the backup procedure manually. 
* You may need to [back up the build agent's data](backing-up-build-agent-s-data.md) only.

__[Restoring data from backup](restoring-teamcity-data-from-backup.md)__ is performed using the `maintainDB` tool.

<note>

We strongly urge you to make the backup of TeamCity data before upgrading. Note that TeamCity server __does not support downgrading__.

## Backing up Data

TeamCity __allows backing up__ the following data:
* [Data stored in the database](manual-backup-and-restore.md#Database+Data)
* Server settings, settings of projects and builds configurations (everything stored in `<`[`TeamCity Data Directory`](teamcity-data-directory.md)`>/config`)
* Custom plugins (installed under `<`[`TeamCity Data Directory`](teamcity-data-directory.md)`>\plugins`) and and database drivers (from `<`[`TeamCity Data Directory`](teamcity-data-directory.md)`>/lib` directory)
* Supplementary data: settings history, triggers states, plugins data, and so on (everything under the `<`[`TeamCity Data Directory`](teamcity-data-directory.md)`>/system/pluginData` directory)
* Build logs
* Personal changes   

The data to be backed up can be configured using the backup scope options when using the [TeamCity Web UI](creating-backup-from-teamcity-web-ui.md) or via additional parameters for the [maintainDB command-line tool](creating-backup-via-maintaindb-command-line-tool.md).

The following data is __not included__ into backup:
* __Build artifacts__ (because of their size). These include explicit build artifacts and internal artifacts storing coverage report, finish build parameters, settings digest, and so on. If you need the build artifacts, please also back up the contents of [artifacts directories](teamcity-configuration-and-maintenance.md) manually.     

[//]: # (Internal note. Do not delete. also https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-43056)

* For backup taken from UI: __running builds and build queue state__.  If you want to back up these, use the command line [maintainDB tool](creating-backup-via-maintaindb-command-line-tool.md) while the TeamCity server is not running.
* TeamCity application manual customizations under `<`[`TeamCity Home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>`, including used server port number which are stored in `<`[`TeamCity Home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>/conf/server.xml` file.
* TeamCity application logs (they also reside under `<`[`TeamCity Home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>/logs`)
* Any manually created files under `<`[`TeamCity Data Directory`](teamcity-data-directory.md)`>` that do not fall into previously mentioned items.   

__The recommended approach__ is either to perform the backup process described under [Manual Backup and Restore](manual-backup-and-restore.md) or run a backup from the [web UI](creating-backup-from-teamcity-web-ui.md) regularly (for example, automated via [REST API](rest-api.md#Data+Backup)) with the "Basic" level â€“ this will ensure backing up all important data except build artifacts and build logs.

Build artifacts and logs (if necessary) can be backed up manually by copying files under `.BuildServer/system/artifacts` (prior to TeamCity 9.0 in `.BuildServer/system/messages`).    
* See [TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md#artifacts) for details.    
* If logs are selected for backup, TeamCity will search for them in [all artifact directories](build-artifact.md) currently specified on the server.

Note that for large production TeamCity installations, exporting and importing of data from/to the database may not be an optimal solution and maintaining database backup via replication might be a better option; for example, see the corresponding [documentation](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication.html) for MySQL database.
