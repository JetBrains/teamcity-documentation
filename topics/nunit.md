The _NUnit_ build runner is intended to run NUnit tests right on the TeamCity server. However, there are other ways to report NUnit tests results to TeamCity, refer to the [NUnit Support](nunit-support.md) page for the details.

<tip include-id="supported-versions">
    
Supported NUnit versions: __2.2.10__, __2.4.1__, __2.4.6__, __2.4.7__, __2.4.8__, __2.5.0__, __2.5.2__, __2.5.3__, __2.5.4__, __2.5.5__, __2.5.6__, __2.5.7__, __2.5.8__, __2.5.9__, __2.5.10__, __2.6.0__, __2.6.1__, __2.6.2__, __2.6.3__. 

__Since TeamCity 9.1__, NUnit __3.0 and above__ is also supported.

It is possible to have several versions of NUnit installed on an agent machine and use any of them in a build.

</tip>    

<warning include-id="supported-warning">
    
NUnit version __3.4.0__ is __not__ supported by the NUnit build runner due to a problem in [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Release-Notes#issues-resolved-1). Only version 3.4.0 was affected, other NUnit 3.x versions work fine with TeamCity.
</warning>

Note that the NUnit runner supports only [.NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/get-started/overview). To run tests for [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/get-started/net-core-and-open-source) projects (and .NET Framework projects version 4.0 or later), use the .NET build runner with the [`test`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test) command instead. Refer to the [NUnit Support](nunit-support.md#Framework+Compatibility) page for details.

## NUnit 3 Requirements
[//]: # (AltHead: NUnit3Extensions)

### Installing NUnit

<chunk include-id="installing-nunit">

To use the TeamCity NUnit build runner, install the [NUnit NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit/) on TeamCity agents first __using one of the following options__:
* Add the NuGet Install build step as the first step of your build configuration.   
For example, you can add a [Command Line](command-line.md) build step before the NUnit build step which will install the `NUnit.Console` NuGet package as follows:

    ```Shell
    %teamcity.tool.NuGet.CommandLine.DEFAULT%\tools\nuget.exe install NUnit.Console -version 3.6.0 -o packages
   
    ```
    
    Note that `%teamcity.tool.NuGet.CommandLine.DEFAULT%` is a reference to the NuGet installed under the TeamCity agent.   
    You can install NuGet on agents from the __Administration | Tools__ page, where you can also mark one of the installed NuGet versions as default.
    
    After that, the `%teamcity.tool.NuGet.CommandLine.DEFAULT%` parameter reference should properly resolve to the NuGet installation path on the agent.   
    Then nunit3-console should appear under the packages directory.   
    
    To run tests, in the next NUnit build step specify the NUnit path in the NUnit settings as `packages\NUnit.ConsoleRunner.3.6.0\tools\nunit3-console.exe`.   
    
    _or_

* Install NUnit manually on all of the agents in some standard location and configure the path to `nunit-console.exe` in your NUnit build step.

</chunk>

### Installing Extensions

Starting from version 3.2.0, NUnit requires the `NUnit.Extension.NUnitProjectLoader` extension to be installed on the TeamCity agent.    
Starting from version 3.4.1, NUnit requires the `NUnit.Extension.TeamCityEventListener` extension to be installed on the TeamCity agent.

The NUnit runner checks for the extensions, and if they are not found, in versions 3.2.0 and 3.2.1 the build will fail without a warning; since version 3.4.1 a message is displayed suggesting you install them.   
The extensions can be installed in bulk using the [NUnit Console Version 3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit.Console) NuGet package or as separate packages: `NUnit.Extension.TeamCityEventListener` and `NUnit.Extension.NUnitProjectLoader`.

Specify the .NET assemblies where the NUnit tests to be run are stored. Multiple entries are comma-separated; usage of MSBuild wildcards is enabled. The paths to assembly files are absolute or relative to the [checkout directory](build-checkout-directory.md). In the following example, TeamCity will search for the tests assemblies in all project directories and run these tests.

```Shell
**\*.dll

<note>

All these wildcards are specified relative to the checkout directory.

In the following example, TeamCity will omit tests specified in this directory.


```Shell

## Code Coverage

To learn about configuring code coverage options, refer to the [Configuring .NET Code Coverage](configuring-.net-code-coverage.md) page.

__For NUnit 3.x__, only [JetBrains dotCover](jetbrains-dotcover.md) is supported as a coverage tool.
