[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Edit Custom Chart Limitations)

Currently, editing a custom chart from the TeamCity UI is limited:
	
* Only one source build configuration could be assigned to a chart.
* It is impossible to move a chart to another project.
* A chart cannot be created if it contains no data.
* A statistic value can be added only if it contains some data.
* The width and height of a chart are not configurable.
* A [patterned statistic value](custom-chart.md#patternedValues) cannot be added or removed.
