By default, TeamCity displays projects, their subprojects, build configurations, and templates in the alphabetical order.

Project administrators can apply custom ordering to subprojects and build configurations on the __Project Settings__ page for the parent project and use it as the default order. To enable reordering, click __Reorder__ above the list of subprojects or build configurations.

Individual users can still manually tweak the display order using the up-down buttons of the [Configure Visible Projects](managing-projects-and-build-configurations.md#Configuring+Visibility) pop-up window on the __Projects Overview__ page.
