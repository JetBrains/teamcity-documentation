Your instance of TeamCity Cloud is installed automatically after your [register an account](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/cloud/) and acquire a [subscription](teamcity-cloud-subscription-and-licensing.md): no extra actions are required. After the server is ready, an invitation link will be sent to your email.

TeamCity Cloud is kept up to date automatically. We upgrade all Cloud instances during the week following each major and minor release. The upgrade occurs in the least loaded server time. The duration of upgrade depends on the size of your instance.

Refer to [TeamCity Release Cycle](teamcity-release-cycle.md) for information on expected release updates.
