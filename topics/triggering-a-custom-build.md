[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Triggering a Custom Build)

A build configuration usually has [build triggers](configuring-build-triggers.md) configured which automatically start a new build each time the conditions are met, like scheduled time, or detection of VCS changes, and so on.

Besides triggering a build automatically, TeamCity allows you to run a build manually whenever you need, and customize this build by adding properties, using specific changes, running the build on a specific agent, and so on.

There are several ways of launching a custom build in TeamCity:
* Click the ellipsis on the __Run__ button, and specify the options in the __Run Custom Build__ dialog described [below](#General+Options).
* To run a custom build with specific changes, open the build results page, go to the [Changes](working-with-build-results.md#Changes) tab, expand the required change, click the __Run build with this change__, and proceed with the [options](#General+Options) in the __Run Custom Build__ dialog.
* Use [HTTP request](accessing-server-by-http.md) or [REST API request](rest-api.md#Triggering+a+Build) to TeamCity to trigger a build.
* Promote a build \- see the section [below](#Promoting+Build).

## Run Custom Build dialog

### General Options

Select an agent you want to run the build on from the drop\-down list. Note that for each agent in the list, TeamCity displays its current state and estimates when the agent will become idle if it is running a build at the moment. Besides the possibility to run a build on a particular agent from the list, you can also use one of the following options:
* __fastest idle agent__: _default option_; if selected, TeamCity will automatically choose an agent to run a build on based on calculated estimates.
* __the fastest agent in &lt;a certain&gt; pool__: if selected, TeamCity will run a build on an agent from a specified pool
* if [cloud integration](teamcity-integration-with-cloud-solutions.md) is configured, you can select to run a build on an agent from a __certain cloud image__. If no available cloud agents of this type exist, TeamCity will also attempt to start a new one.
* __run a build on &lt;a specified&gt; agent__
* __All enabled compatible agents__: Use this option to run a build simultaneously on all agents that are enabled and compatible with the build configuration. This option may be useful in the following cases:
  * run a build for agent maintenance purposes (e.g. you can create a configuration to check whether agents function properly after an environment upgrade/update).
  * run a build on different platforms (for example, you can set up a configuration, and specify for it a number of compatible build agents with different environments installed).

On the __General__ options you can also specify whether
* this particular build will be run as a [personal](personal-build.md) one
* this particular build will be put at the top of the [build queue](build-queue.md)
* all files in the [build checkout directory](build-checkout-directory.md) will be cleaned before this build.
   * __Since TeamCity 2017.1__, if snapshot dependencies are configured, this option can be applied to snapshot dependencies. In this case, all the builds of the build chain will be forced to use clean checkout. The option also enables rebuilding all dependencies (unless custom dependencies are provided via this dialog or the schedule trigger promotes a build).

### Dependencies

_This tab is available only for builds that have dependencies on other builds_.   
You can enforce rebuilding of all dependencies and select a particular build whose artifacts will be taken. By default, the last 20 builds are displayed. To increase the number of builds displayed in the drop\-down to 50, use the `teamcity.runCustomBuild.buildsLimit=50` [internal property](configuring-teamcity-server-startup-properties.md#TeamCity+internal+properties).

### Changes

_This tab is available only if you have permissions to access VCS roots for the build configuration._   
The tab allows you to specify a particular change to be included to the build.

The build will use the change's revision to checkout the sources. That is, all the changes up to the selected one will be included into the build.   
Note that TeamCity displays only the changes detected earlier for the current build configuration VCS roots. If the VCS root was detached from the build configuration after the change occurred, there is no ability to run the build on such a change. A limited number of changes is displayed. If there is an earlier change in TeamCity that you need to run a build on, you can locate the change in the Change Log and use the __Run build with this change__ action.

### Include changes

The __Include changes__ drop\-down allows selecting the changes in the VCS roots attached to the configuration to run the build on.
* __Latest changes at the moment the build is started__: TeamCity will automatically include all changes available at the moment.
* &lt;Last change to include&gt;: When you select a change in the drop\-down list, TeamCity runs the build with the selected change and all changes that were made before it. The build run with the changes earlier than the latest available is marked as a [History Build](history-build.md).

### Build branch

The __Build branch__ drop\-down, available if you have branches in your build configuration (or in snapshot dependencies of this build configuration), allows choosing a branch to be used for the custom build.

### Use settings

If your project has [versioned settings](storing-project-settings-in-version-control.md) enabled, you can tell TeamCity to run a build:
* with the settings defined for the project, either the current settings on the server or the settings from VCS
* with the project settings currently defined on the server
* with the settings loaded from the VCS revision calculated for the build.

If changes are selected in the [step above](#Include+changes), the revision of the project settings corresponding to the selected changes will be loaded.

To define which settings to take, use one of the corresponding options from the _Use settings_ drop-down menu (the option here will override the [project-level setting](storing-project-settings-in-version-control.md#Defining+Settings+to+Apply+to+Builds)).

### Parameters

<note>
 
These settings are available only if you have permissions to change system properties and environment variables for the build configuration.

</note>

This tab allows adding, editing, and deleting new parameters/properties/variables, or redefining their [predefined values](predefined-build-parameters.md).   
When adding/editing/deleting properties and variables, note the following:
* For a predefined property/variable, only the value is editable.
* Only newly added properties/variables can be deleted. You cannot delete predefined properties.
* Each parameter value must be no longer than 16,000 characters.

### Comment and Tags

Add an optional comment as well as one or more [tags](build-tag.md) to the build. You can also add a custom build to [favorites](favorite-build.md) by checking the corresponding box in this section.

<note>

A greater build number does not mean more recent changes and the last build in the builds history does not reflect the state of the latest project sources: builds in the builds history are sorted by their start time, not by changes they include.
</note>

## Promoting Build

Build promotion refers to triggering a custom build with an overridden [artifact or snapshot dependency](dependent-build.md), i.e. manual launching of a build with dependencies configured, but using a build different from the build specified in the dependency.

To promote a build, open the build results page of the dependency build and click __Actions | Promote__.

For example, your build configuration A is configured to take artifacts from the last successful build of configuration B, but you want to run a build of configuration A using artifacts of a different build of configuration B (not the last successful build), so you promote an earlier build of B.   
Build promotion affects only a single run of the dependent build. Once you click __Promote__, a build of the dependent build configuration which uses the artifacts of the specified build is queued. Any further runs of the dependent build configuration will use artifacts as configured (last successful, last pinned etc.), unless you use another promotion.
