[//]: # (title: Pull Requests)
[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Pull Requests)

The _Pull Requests_ [build feature](adding-build-features.md) enhances TeamCity integration with pull (merge) requests in [GitHub](#GitHub+Pull+Requests), [Bitbucket Server](#Bitbucket+Server+Pull+Requests), [Bitbucket Cloud](#Bitbucket+Cloud+Pull+Requests), [GitLab](#GitLab+Merge+Requests), [Azure DevOps](#Azure+DevOps+Pull+Requests), and [JetBrains Space](#JetBrains+Space+Merge+Requests) repositories.

## Common Information

Adding the Pull Requests feature to a build configuration allows you to:

* View pull request branches and their pending changes on the build configuration's overview page.

   <img src="dk-pull-branches.png" width="706" alt="New pull branches on the main build configuration page"/>

* View pull request's details on the **Overview** tab of the [build results page](build-results-page.md).

   <img src="pr-info.png" alt="Pull request details" width="706" border-effect="line"/>
   
   In the case of a draft pull request, the icon is grayed-out and the **Draft** status appears before the pull request number:
   
   <img src="pr-info2.png" alt="Pull request details" width="706" border-effect="line"/>

* Set up specific criteria that govern which pull requests to monitor. You can filter pull requests by their authors, target and origin branches.

   <include from="branch-filter.md" element-id="vcs-branch-names-for-prs"/>

* Set up a workflow in which developers work in their local branches and TeamCity does not waste resources building these changes unless they are sent as a pull (merge) request (see the [](#Interaction+with+VCS+Roots) section).


The Pull Requests feature **does not** automatically trigger new builds against pull (merge) request branches. To assess changes from pull request branches before they are merged into the main codebase, add a [VCS trigger](configuring-vcs-triggers.md) that targets required branches (for example, `refs/pull/*` for GitHub). New build configurations created in TeamCity UI already include a trigger with the `+:*` specification, which allows TeamCity to build changes from pull (merge) request branches.

> If your build configuration targets a public repository where non-trusted users can push commits or create pull (merge) requests, building these changes means TeamCity can execute malicious code introduced in them. For example, TeamCity may handle a harmful [service message](service-messages.md) sent from the source code or apply altered [project settings](storing-project-settings-in-version-control.md) from modified `.teamcity` folder files.
> 
> To prevent this from happening, do not configure [VCS triggers](configuring-vcs-triggers.md) and [Pull Requests build features](pull-requests.md) in such a manner that builds with unverified pull (merge) request changes can start automatically. Instead, either start new builds manually after you inspect and verify incoming changes, or set up [](untrusted-builds.md) to require additional review for external pull requests. 
>
> See this section for more information about potential damage caused by users who can modify repository code: [](security-notes.md#manage-permissions).
>
{style="warning"}


If your project targets a GitHub or GitLab repository, you can automate your setup even further by letting TeamCity build pull request branches and merge those requests that yield successful builds. To do this, add the [Automatic Merge](automatic-merge.md) build feature in addition to **Pull Requests**.

## Interaction with VCS Roots

The Pull Requests feature extends the original branch specification of [VCS roots](vcs-root.md) attached to the current build configuration. As such, branch specifications of a VCS root **must not** contain patterns that match pull request branches to avoid ambiguous and unexpected behavior.

If you want to build **only** pull requests, clear the VCS root's branch specification.


```Kotlin
object MyRepoRoot : GitVcsRoot({
    name = "MyRoot"
    url = "https://github.com/username/reponame"
    branch = "refs/heads/main"
    // the "branchSpec = ..." parameter is missing
})
```

The sample below illustrates how to correctly set up your TeamCity project so that the root branch specifications and the Pull Requests feature complete each other to implement the following workflow:

* TeamCity tracks only `main`, `production`, and `sandbox` branches, as well as all branches that start with "release-" (for example, `release-2077.02`).

* Developers can create local branches and work with them without any exposure to TeamCity.

* When a developer is ready to publish their changes, they can create a request to merge their commits from a personal (untracked) into core (tracked) branch. This will result in a new pull branch (for example, `refs/pull/54` on GitHub). The Pull Requests feature will detect this new branch, making it possible to build and test changes in TeamCity before they are merged.

* Due to feature's **Filter by author** setting, TeamCity ignores similar `refs/pull/<Int>` branches created for unauthorized (external) users' requests.

```Kotlin
project {
    vcsRoot(MyRepoRoot)
    buildType(Build)
}

object Build : BuildType({
    name = "Build"
    vcs { root(MyRepoRoot) }

    // ...

    features {
        pullRequests {
            vcsRootExtId = "${MyRepoRoot.id}"
            provider = github {
                authType = vcsRoot()
                filterAuthorRole = PullRequests.GitHubRoleFilter.MEMBER
            }
        }
    }
})

object MyRepoRoot : GitVcsRoot({
    name = "MyRoot"
    url = "https://github.com/username/reponame"
    branch = "refs/heads/main"
    branchSpec = """
        refs/heads/main
        refs/heads/production
        refs/heads/sandbox
        refs/heads/release-*
    """.trimIndent()
})
```

<!--

## Pull Request Branch Filters

After you configure the **Pull Requests** feature in your build configurations, you can add `+|-pr <attribute>=<value>` expressions to branch filters of triggers, notifications, configuration Version Control Settings, and more. These expressions allow corresponding objects to work only with specific pull (merge) requests. For example, you can set up the triggers to start new builds only for non-draft requests coming from your organization members. Refer to this section for more information: [](branch-filter.md#Pull+Request+Branch+Filters).

## VCS-specific settings

### GitHub Pull Requests

This feature supports [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise). It monitors builds only on the `refs/pull/*/head` branch.

The following parameters are available for the GitHub hosting type:

### Bitbucket Cloud Pull Requests

<video src="https://youtu.be/M2wi6l0pZe4"
title="New in TeamCity 2020.2: Bitbucket Cloud Pull Request Support"/>

Since Bitbucket Cloud does not create dedicated branches for pull requests, this build feature monitors directly source branches in a source repository (forks are not supported).   
If more than one pull request is submitted from the same source branch at the moment of the build start, TeamCity will display all these requests in the build results. However, only commits from the open PRs matching the filtering criteria will be displayed as _Changes_ of the build.

Note that the branch specification of the VCS root __must not__ contain patterns matching pull request branches.

The following parameters are available for the [Bitbucket Cloud](https://bitbucket.org/) hosting type:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Setting</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td>Authentication Type</td>
<td>

* **Use VCS root credentials** — TeamCity will try to extract username/password credentials from the VCS root settings if the VCS root uses HTTP(S) fetch URL. This option will not work if the VCS root uses an SSH fetch URL or employs anonymous authentication.

* **Username/password** — Specify a username and password for connection to Bitbucket Cloud. We recommend using an [app password](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/) with the _Pull Requests | Read_ scope.

* **Refreshable access token** — Displays a list of configured Bitbucket Cloud [OAuth connections](configuring-connections.md#Bitbucket+Cloud). Click the **Acquire** button next to the connection that should be used to issue a short-lived OAuth token.
  <img src="dk-pullrequests-BBC-tokens.png" width="706" alt="PR Token for Bitbucket Cloud"/>

* **Permanent Access Token** — Enter a Bitbucket [Repository Access Token](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-a-repository-access-token/), [Project Access Token](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/using-project-access-tokens/), or [Workspace Access Token](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/using-workspace-access-tokens/) to configure long-lived access to a repository, workspace, or project. The token must be configured with the _Pull Requests | Read_ scope.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>By target branch</td>
<td>

Define the [branch filter](branch-filter.md) to monitor pull requests only on branches that match the specified criteria. If left empty, no filters apply.

</td>
</tr>

</table>

### GitLab Merge Requests

TeamCity processes GitLab [merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/index.html) similarly to how it processes pull requests in other hosting services. Currently, TeamCity detects only merge requests submitted after this build feature is enabled.

This feature monitors builds only on the `refs/merge-requests/*/head` branch.

The following parameters are available for the [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) hosting type:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="150">

Parameter

</td>

<td>

Description

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

Authentication Type

</td>

<td>

* **Use VCS root credentials** — TeamCity will try to extract login credentials or access token from the VCS root settings if the VCS root uses HTTP(S) fetch URL. This option will not work if the VCS root employs anonymous authentication.

* **Personal Access Token** — Use a personal access token issued in GitLab. It must have either the `api` scope.

* **GitLab Application Token** — Displays a list of configured [GitLab OAuth connections](configuring-connections.md#GitLab). Click the **Acquire** button next to the connection that should be used to issue a short-lived OAuth token.

By default, the Pull Requests build feature loads the [GitLab draft merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/drafts.html)
information and runs builds on draft merge requests. The build page displays a grayed-out icon and the **Draft** status next to the merge request number.

Check the box to ignore GitLab draft merge requests. TeamCity will not load draft merge request information and a merge request is ignored until its status changes to non-draft.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

Server URL

</td>

<td>

Specify a GitLab URL for connection.

If left empty, the URL will be extracted from the VCS root fetch URL.

</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Azure DevOps Pull Requests

This feature monitors builds only on the `refs/pull/*/merge` branch.

In case with [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), TeamCity detects requests on a merge branch — not on the pull request itself as with other VCSs. Each build will be launched on a virtual branch showing an actual result of the build after merging the PR. Thus, the build will contain both the commit with changes and the virtual merge commit.

Note that the feature ignores Azure DevOps draft pull requests.

**Authentication Settings**

* **Personal Access Token** — a static token that you can [issue in your Azure DevOps account settings](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/setup-admin/team-services/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate). Your issued token should have the `Code (read)` scope to allow Pull Requests to retrieve required information.

* **Refreshable access token** — a short-lived token issued via a configured [Azure OAuth 2.0 connection](configuring-connections.md#azure-devops-connection). Click the **Acquire** button next to a required connection to obtain an access token.

    <img src="dk-azure-pullRequestTokens.png" width="706" alt="Refreshable tokens for Azure DevOps"/>


**Pull Request Filtering**

* **By source branch** — the [branch filter](branch-filter.md) to monitor pull requests only on source branches that match the specified criteria. If left empty, no filters apply.

* **By target branch** — the [branch filter](branch-filter.md) to monitor pull requests only on target branches that match the specified criteria. If left empty, no filters apply.


**Other Settings**


* **Project URL** — a project URL for synchronization with the remote Azure DevOps server. This field is recommended for on-premises Azure DevOps installations. If left empty, the URL will be composed based on the VCS root fetch URL.



### JetBrains Space Merge Requests

>If you are looking for how to integrate your JetBrains Space instance with TeamCity, check out this **[full integration guide](how-to-configure-cicd-for-jetbrains-space.md)**!

This feature monitors merge requests directly in the source branches of an origin repository.  
If more than one merge request is submitted from the same source branch, TeamCity will display all these requests in the build results. However, only commits from the open requests matching the filtering criteria will be displayed as [Changes](build-results-page.md#Changes+Tab) of the build.

The following parameters are available for the [JetBrains Space](https://www.jetbrains.com/space/) hosting type:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="150">

Parameter

</td>

<td>

Description

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

Connection

</td>

<td>

Choose a preconfigured [connection to JetBrains Space](configuring-connections.md#jetbrains-space-connection).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

By target branch

</td>

<td>

Define the [branch filter](branch-filter.md) to monitor merge requests only on branches that match the specified criteria. If left empty, no filters apply.
</td>
</tr>

</table>

If you want to run several parallel builds to pretest a request before merging it, the best solution is to:
1. Create a [composite build configuration](composite-build-configuration.md) and attach your JetBrains Space [VCS root](configuring-vcs-roots.md) with an empty branch specification to it.
2. Add the composite build configuration at the end of the build chain by configuring its [snapshot dependencies](build-dependencies-setup.md#Snapshot+Dependencies) on parallel builds with tests.
3. Add the _Pull Requests_ feature to each build configuration of the chain so that all builds can detect changes in a merge request branch. You can preconfigure all settings in a [build configuration template](build-configuration-template.md) and then create these build configurations based on it.
4. In the composite build configuration settings:
   * Add a [VCS trigger](configuring-vcs-triggers.md) to automatically run builds on changes detected in the merge request branch.
   * Add the [Commit Status Publisher](commit-status-publisher.md#JetBrains+Space) feature to send the build statuses to the commit details in JetBrains Space.  
   If you want other builds of the chain to report their statuses to JetBrains Space (for example, _deployment_ or _integration testing_ builds), add the _Commit Status Publisher_ feature to the corresponding build configurations.     

After that, TeamCity will automatically run builds on changes in a merge request branch submitted to your JetBrains Space repo and publish build statuses to the merge request timeline in Space:

<img src="space-timeline.png" alt="Space merge request timeline" width="700"/>

To protect a JetBrains Space branch from unverified merge requests, you can also configure [Quality Gates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/branch-and-merge-restrictions.html#quality-gates-for-merge-requests) in your repository settings. If you set a TeamCity build as an external check, JetBrains Space will require the build on a merge request to finish successfully before allowing this request to be merged.

See known issues with processing JetBrains Space merge requests [here](known-issues.md#Known+issues+of+Pull+Requests+build+feature).

## Predefined build parameters for pull requests

TeamCity provides multiple [predefined build parameters](predefined-build-parameters.md) that expose valuable information on pull requests for builds with the enabled Pull Requests [feature](adding-build-features.md):
 
```Text
teamcity.pullRequest.number //pull request number
teamcity.pullRequest.title //pull request title
teamcity.pullRequest.source.branch //VCS name of the source branch; provided only if the source repository is the same as the target one
teamcity.pullRequest.target.branch //VCS name of the target branch

```

You can use these parameters in the settings of a build configuration or in build scripts.

## Pull Requests workflow example

Let's say you have the following environment set up:
* Public GitHub repository `web-app` with the default branch `master`.
* TeamCity project.
    * Build configuration `web-app` that uses files from the `web-app` repository to build a web application.

The members of your [organization](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-organizations) propose changes to the sources by sending pull requests to the `master` branch, and you want these changes to be automatically built and tested in TeamCity before you merge them.   
TeamCity can detect each pull request sent to the `master` branch and build the web application based on the updated sources.

To configure the described workflow for the `web-app` build configuration in TeamCity:
1. Add a [VCS root](vcs-root.md) to the build configuration:   
   * Go to __Build Configuration Settings | Version Control Settings__ and click __Attach VCS root__.
   * Configure the root parameters:
      - __Type of VCS__: _Git_
      - __VCS root name__: _\<unique_root_name\>_
      - __Fetch URL__: _\<GitHub_repository_URL\>_
      - __Default branch__: the branch to be monitored; by default, _`refs/heads/master`_ (read more [about feature branches](working-with-feature-branches.md))
      - __Branch specification__: a filter for additional branches to be monitored (for example, _`+:refs/heads/*`_)
      - __Authentication Settings__ of the GitHub user that has access rights to the `web-app` repository
   * Test the connection and, if successful, click __Create__.
2. Add the _Pull Requests_ [build feature](adding-build-features.md) to the build configuration:
   * Go to __Build Configuration Settings | Build Features__ and click __Add build feature__.
   * Configure the feature parameters:
        * __VCS Root__: the VCS root created at Step 1
        * __VCS hosting type__: _GitHub_
        * __Authentication Type__: _Use VCS root credentials_, or select _Access token_ to use a GitHub token instead        
        * __Pull Requests filtering__:
           * __By authors__: _Members of the same organization_
           * __By target branch__: leave empty to apply no filters and monitor all new pull requests in the repository, or explicitly specify the target branch (in this example, _`master`_)
   * Test the connection and, if successful, click __Save__.
3. Add a [VCS trigger](configuring-vcs-triggers.md) to the build configuration.

With this integration in place, whenever a member of your GitHub organization sends a pull request to the `master` branch, TeamCity does the following:

1. Detects the pull request sent to the `master` branch.
2. Runs the `web-app` build configuration: collects sources, builds and tests the app according to your predefined build steps.
3. Displays information about the processed pull request on the build configuration __Overview__ page. You can instantly see the pull request status (1) and refresh the information about its state (2).
   
   <img src="PullRequestOverviewInfo.png" width="500" alt="Pull Request information in Build Overview"/>

__Pro Tips__

You can automate your setup further, so TeamCity:
* Sends a build status back to GitHub after the build finishes, with the [Commit Status Publisher](commit-status-publisher.md) build feature.
* Merges the pull request in GitHub if the build finishes successfully, with the [Automatic Merge](automatic-merge.md) build feature.
* If you want to run a whole [build chain](build-chain.md) on a pull request, remember to add the Pull Requests feature to each build configuration of the chain. To simplify this procedure, you can set everything in a [build configuration template](build-configuration-template.md) and then create these build configurations based on it.

## Troubleshooting
{product="tc"}

TeamCity [writes events](teamcity-server-logs.md) related to the Pull Requests build feature to the `teamcity-pull-requests.log` file. Apply the "debug-pull-requests" preset to include DEBUG-level events to this log.
