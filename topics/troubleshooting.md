When a problem occurs with TeamCity, we recommend first checking the [Common Problems](common-problems.md) and [Known Issues](known-issues.md) pages to see if there is existing guidance for the issue you are experiencing.

If you need additional help, we offer several convenient options:

* [Issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/TW) (public, with an option for private): Log bugs or feature requests.

* [Support ticket](ticket-based-support.md) (private): Available only for customers with active Enterprise server [licenses](licensing-policy.md) to receive direct assistance from our support team.

* [Support ticket](ticket-based-support.md) (private)
  {instance="tcc"}

* [Community forum](https://jb.gg/teamcity-forum) (public): Engage in discussions with the wider user community.

These options are described in more detail below.


### Issue Tracker

Our [public issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/TW) allows you to check if somebody has already reported your problem. If the same issue exists, please vote for it.

Although issues in our issue tracker are public by default, you do have an option to create a private issue, or add private comments/attachments to public issues. You can do this by setting the visibility only to the `teamcity-developers` group.

If you are certain you have encountered a bug, collect the relevant data about the problem and post a new issue in the issue tracker.

Feature requests can also be logged through our issue tracker.

### Support Ticket

Customers who own a TeamCity Enterprise server license with active maintenance can submit a ticket directly to our support team. We use Zendesk for our ticketing system, and tickets can be submitted through the [online support form](https://teamcity-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=66621) or by [email](mailto:teamcity-support@jetbrains.com).

## Data Security

We encourage making your posts publicly available so that other users can contribute based on their experience and benefit from the answers.

All data in the [JetBrains community forum](https://jb.gg/teamcity-forum) is public. Issues in the [JetBrains issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/TW) are public by default; however, there is an option to create issues visible only to the JetBrains team. Additionally, private comments and attachments can be added to public issues.

If you need to share information that is not intended for public access, you can use the following methods:

* Post a comment or attach files to the issue in the [JetBrains issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/TW), making them visible only to the `teamcity-developers` group.

* Attach the data to a support ticket. View the [Ticket-Based Support](ticket-based-support.md) page for contact details.

* For files exceeding 10MB, upload them to the [JetBrains Upload Service](reporting-issues.md#Uploading+Large+Data+Archives) and share the Upload ID in the related support case.

All data marked as non-public is used solely for investigating the related issue and is discarded afterward.

During transfer and storage, the data may reside on third-party servers, such as mail servers, Amazon AWS servers, Zendesk, and others.

For more details, please refer to the [JetBrains Privacy Policy](https://www.jetbrains.com/company/privacy.html).
