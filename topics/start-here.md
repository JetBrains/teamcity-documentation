TeamCity is a powerful and scalable CI/CD solution, adaptable for businesses of any size — from small teams with simple setups to large enterprises managing thousands of build agents running diverse configurations. Whether your team consists of just a few people sharing equal responsibilities or a larger group with specialized roles, tasks typically fall into three main categories:

Server administration
: Involves configuring and maintaining the core TeamCity infrastructure, including the TeamCity server, nodes, build agents (both cloud and local), proxies, databases, and more. Server admins also manage user access and handle maintenance routines like backups and cleanups.
: See the [](server-administrator-guide.md) section for more information.

Project administration
: Focuses on creating and managing projects and build configurations, integrating TeamCity with external services (such as version control systems, artifact storage, and image registries), and setting up user permissions for individual projects.
: Refer to the [](project-administrator-guide.md) section to learn more.

Regular operations
: Daily tasks of running builds (whether through the TeamCity UI or an IDE), tracking and investigating build results, and more.
: The [](user-guide.md) section covers these basic operations.

* TeamCity seamlessly integrates with a wide range of VCS hosting platforms, cloud providers, issue trackers, and other essential development tools. For a comprehensive overview of available integrations, visit the [](integrating-teamcity-with-other-tools.md) section.
* Every development team operates with its own unique combination of tools, languages, and workflows. To tailor TeamCity to your specific business needs, explore the [](extending-teamcity.md) section. This section explains how to leverage custom plugins and the robust REST API, which allows you to manage everything from server-wide settings to individual test investigations and mutes.
* CI/CD systems often involve complex setups that combine bare-metal and cloud machines, various tools, custom scripts, and unique environments. When things go wrong, troubleshooting can be challenging. To help you quickly resolve issues, we’ve compiled a list of common problems and solutions in the [](troubleshooting.md) section.
