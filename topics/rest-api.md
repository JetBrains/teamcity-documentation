## General information
 
REST API is an open\-source [plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/teamcity-rest) bundled __since TeamCity 5.0__.
 
To use the REST API, an application makes an HTTP request to the TeamCity server and parses the response.
 
The TeamCity REST API can be used for integrating applications with TeamCity and for those who want to script interactions with the TeamCity server. TeamCity's REST API allows accessing resources (entities) via URL paths.
 
<tip>
 
The URL examples on this page assume that your TeamCity server web UI is accessible via the [`http://teamcity:8111`](http://teamcity:8111) URL.
</tip>
 
### General Usage Principles
 
This documentation is not a complete guide and will only provide some initial knowledge useful for using the API.
 
You can start by opening [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server) URL in your browser: this page will give you several pointers to explore the API.
 
Use [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/application.wadl`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/application.wadl) to get the full list of supported requests and names of parameters. This is the primary source of discovery for the supported requests and their parameters. The same data is also exposed in [Swagger](https://swagger.io/tools/open-source/getting-started/) format via [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/swagger.json`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/swagger.json) endpoint.
 
Make sure you read through this section before using the API.
 
For the list of supported [locator dimensions](#Locator) included into the error response, use the `$help` locator.
 
Experiment and read the error messages returned: for the most part they should guide you to the right requests.
 
Suppose you want to know more on the agents and see (in  the `/app/rest/server` response) that there is an `/app/rest/agents` URL.
* Try the `/app/rest/agents/` request \- see the authorized agent list, get the `default` way of linking to an agent from the agent's element `href` attribute.
* Get individual agent details via the `/app/rest/agents/id:10` URL (obtained from `href` for one of the elements of the previous request).
* If you send a request to `/app/rest/agents/$help`, or `/app/rest/agents/aaa:bbb` (supplying unsupported locator dimension), you will get the list of the supported dimensions to find an agent via the agent's [locator](#Locator).
* Most of the attributes of the returned agent data (`name`, `connected`, `authorized`) can be used as the `<field name>` in the `app/rest/agents/<agentLocator>/<field name>` request. Moreover, if you issue a request to the `app/rest/agents/id:10/test` URL, you will get a list of the supported fields in the error message.
 
 
### REST Authentication
 
 
You can authenticate yourself for the REST API in the following ways:
* Since __Teamcity 2019.1__, the preferred way to access REST API is by using the [token-based HTTP authentication](configuring-authentication-settings.md#Token-Based+Authentication). Provide your personal TeamCity access token generated on __My Settings &amp; Tools | Access Tokens__ in the HTTP header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. For example:
    ```Shell
    curl --header "Authorization: Bearer tokenValue" http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds
    ```
* Using basic HTTP authentication (it can be slow with certain authentications, see below). Provide a valid TeamCity username and password with the request. You can force basic auth by including `httpAuth` before the `/app/rest` part, e.g. [`http://teamcity:8111/httpAuth/app/rest/builds`](http://teamcity:8111/httpAuth/app/rest/builds).
* Using access to the server as a [guest user](guest-user.md) (if enabled) include `guestAuth` before the `/app/rest` part, e.g. [`http://teamcity:8111/guestAuth/app/rest/builds`](http://teamcity:8111/guestAuth/app/rest/builds).
* If you are checking REST `GET` requests from within a browser, and you are logged in to TeamCity in the browser, you can just use `/app/rest` URL, e.g. [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds). 
Authentication can be slow when a basic HTTP authentication with a non-built-in module is used. If you want to use basic HTTP authentication instead of token-based one, consider applying the [session reuse approach](http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-14209#comment=27-485445) for reusing authentication between sequential requests.
 
If you perform a request from within a TeamCity build, for a limited set of build\-related operations (like downloading artifacts) you can use values of [`teamcity.auth.userId/teamcity.auth.password`](artifact-dependencies.md#Build-level+authentication) system properties as basic credentials (within TeamCity settings you can reference them as `%system.teamcity.auth.userId%` and `%system.teamcity.auth.password%`).
 
Within a build, the request for current build details can look like:
 
```Shell
curl -u "%system.teamcity.auth.userId%:%system.teamcity.auth.password%" "%teamcity.serverUrl%/httpAuth/app/rest/builds/id:%teamcity.build.id%"
 
```
 
### Superuser access
 
You can use the [super user account](super-user.md) with REST API: just provide no username and the generated password logged into the server log.
 
 
### REST API Versions
 
As REST API evolves from one TeamCity version to another, there can be incompatible changes in the protocol.
 
Under the [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/) or [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/latest`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/latest) URL the latest version is available. Under the [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/<version>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/<version>) URL, the current version is available and earlier versions CAN be available. Our general policy is to supply TeamCity with at least one previous version. For example, in TeamCity 2019.1 for `<version>` you can use "2019.1" for the current and "2018.1", "2018.2", "2017.2", "2017.1", "10.0", "9.1", "9.0", "8.1", "8.0" to get earlier versions of the protocol. The protocol version corresponds to the TeamCity version where it was first introduced.
 
Breaking changes in the API are described in the related [Upgrade Notes](upgrade-notes.md) section. Note that additions to the objects returned (such as new XML attributes or elements) are not considered major changes and do not cause the protocol version to increment. Also, the endpoints marked with `Experimental` comment in `application.wadl` may change without a special notice in future versions.
 
<note>
 
The examples on this page use the `/app/rest` relative URL; replace it with the one containing the version if necessary.
</note>
 
### URL Structure
 
The general structure of the URL in the TeamCity API is [`http://teamcityserver:port/<authType>/app/rest/<apiVersion>/<restApiPath>?<parameters>`](http://teamcityserver:port/<authType>/app/rest/<apiVersion>/<restApiPath>?<parameters>)
 
 
where
* `teamcityserver` and `port` define the server name and the port used by TeamCity. This page uses [`http://teamcity:8111/`](http://teamcity:8111/) as an example URL.
* `<authType>` (optional) is the [authentication type](#REST+Authentication) to be used, this is generic TeamCity functionality.
* `app/rest` is the root path of the TeamCity REST API
* `<apiVersion>` (optional) is a reference to a specific version of REST API.
* `<restApiPath>?<parameters>` is the REST API part of the URL.  
A typical way to get multiple items is to use `<restApiPath>` in the form of `.../app/rest/<items>` (for example, "`.../app/rest/builds`"). These URLs regularly accept the [locator](#Locator) parameter which can filter the items returned. Individual items can regularly be addressed by a URL in the form of `.../app/rest/<items>/<item_locator>`. This URL always returns a single item. If the `<item_locator>` locator matches several items, the first one is returned. Both multiple and single items requests regularly support the [fields](#Full+and+Partial+Responses) parameter.
 
 
### Locator
 
In a number of places, you can specify a filter string which defines what entities to filter/affect in the request. This string representation is referred to as "locator" in the scope of REST API.
 
The locators formats can be:
* single value: a string without the following symbols: `,:-( )`
* dimension allowing you to filter entities using multiple criteria: `<dimension1>:<value1>,<dimension2>:<value2>,<dimension3>:(<dimension3.1>:<value3.1>,<dimension3.2>:<value3.2>)`
Refer to each entity description below for the most popular locator descriptions. If in doubt what a specific locator supports, send a request with "$help" as the locator value. In response you will get a textual description of what the locator supports. If a request with invalid locators is sent, the error messages often hint at the error and list the supported locator dimensions as well.
 
<note>
 
If the value contains the "," symbol, it should be enclosed into parentheses: `(<value>)`. The value of a dimension can also be encoded as Base64url ("URL and Filename safe type base64" from RFC4648) and sent as `<dimension>:($base64:<base64-encoded-value>)` instead of `<dimension>: <value>`.
</note>
 
 
Examples:
 
* Use [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/projects`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/projects) to get the list of projects.
* Use [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/projects/<projectsLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/projects/<projectsLocator>), for example [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/projects/id:RESTAPIPlugin`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/projects/id:RESTAPIPlugin) (example ID is used) to get the full data for the REST API Plugin project.
* Use [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/id:bt284/builds?locator=<buildLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/id:bt284/builds?locator=<buildLocator>), for example [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/id:bt284/builds?locator=status:SUCCESS,tag:EAP`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/id:bt284/builds?locator=status:SUCCESS,tag:EAP) (example IDs are used) to get builds.
* Use [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/?locator=<buildLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/?locator=<buildLocator>) to get builds by build locator.
 
 
### Supported HTTP Methods
* GET: retrieves the requested data. For example, `.../app/rest/entities` usually retrieves a list of entities, `.../app/rest/entities/<entity locator>` retrieves a single entity
* POST: creates the entity from the payload submitted. To create a new entity, one regularly needs to post a single entity data (i.e. as retrieved via GET) to the `.../app/rest/entities` URL. When posting XML, be sure to specify the "`Content\-Type: application/xml`" HTTP header.
* PUT: updates the data from the payload submitted. Accepts the same data format as retrieved via GET request to the same URL. Supported for some entities for URLs like `.../app/rest/entities/<entity locator>`
* DELETE: removes the data at the URL, for example, for the `.../app/rest/entities/<entity locator>`
 
## Response Formats
 
The TeamCity REST APIs returns HTTP responses in the following formats according to the  HTTP "Accept" header:
 
<table>
 
<tr>
 
<td>
Format
 
</td>
 
<td>
 
Response Type
 
</td>
 
<td>
 
HTTP "Accept" header value
 
</td>
 
</tr>
 
<tr>
 
<td>
 
plain text
 
</td>
 
<td>
 
single\-value responses
 
</td>
 
<td>
text/plain
 
</td></tr><tr>
 
<td>
 
XML
 
</td>
 
<td>
 
complex value responses
 
</td>
 
<td>
 
application/xml
 
</td>
 
</tr>
 
<tr>
 
<td>
JSON
 
 
</td>
 
<td>
complex value responses
 
 
</td>
 
<td>
application/json
 
 
</td></tr></table>
 
### Full and Partial Responses
 
By default, when a list of entities is requested, only basic fields are included into the response. When a single entry is requested, all the fields are returned. The complex field values can be returned in full or basic form, depending on a specific entity.
 
It is possible to change the set of fields returned for XML and JSON responses for the majority of requests.This is done by supplying the __fields__ request parameter describing the fields of the top\-level entity and sub\-entities to return in the response. An example syntax of the parameter is: `field,field2(field2_subfield1,field2_subfield1)`. This basically means "include `field` and `field2` of the top\-level entity and for `field2` include `field2_subfield1` and `field2_subfield1` fields". The order of the fields specification plays no role.
 
Examples:
 
* [`http://teamcity.jetbrains.com/app/rest/buildTypes?locator=affectedProject:(id:TeamCityPluginsByJetBrains)&fields=buildType(id,name,project)`](http://teamcity.jetbrains.com/app/rest/buildTypes?locator=affectedProject:(id:TeamCityPluginsByJetBrains)&fields=buildType(id,name,project))
* [`http://teamcity.jetbrains.com/app/rest/builds?locator=buildType:(id:bt345),count:10&fields=count,build(number,status,statusText,agent,lastChange,tags,pinned)`](http://teamcity.jetbrains.com/app/rest/builds?locator=buildType:(id:bt345),count:10&fields=count,build(number,status,statusText,agent,lastChange,tags,pinned))
 
At this time, the response can sometimes include the fields/elements not specifically requested. This can change in the future versions, so it is recommended to specify all the fields/elements used by the client.
 
### Logging
 
You can get details on errors and REST request processing in `logs\teamcity-rest.log` [server log](teamcity-server-logs.md).
 
You can get details on errors and REST request processing in `logs\teamcity-rest.log` [server log](teamcity-server-logs.md).
 
If you get an error in response to your request and want to investigate the reason, look into [rest-related server logs](#Logging).
 
To get details about each processed request, turn on debug logging (e.g. set Logging Preset to `debug-rest` on the [Administration/Diagnostics](teamcity-monitoring-and-diagnostics.md#Debug+Logging) page or modify the Log4J `jetbrains.buildServer.server.rest` category).
 
### CORS Support
 
The TeamCity REST API can be configured to allow [cross-origin requests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) using the `rest.cors.origins` [internal property](configuring-teamcity-server-startup-properties.md#TeamCity+internal+properties).
 
To allow requests from a page loaded from a specific domain, add the page address (including the __protocol and port__, __do not use wildcards__) to the comma\-separated [internal property](configuring-teamcity-server-startup-properties.md#TeamCity+internal+properties) `rest.cors.origins`, for example, `rest.cors.origins=http://myinternalwebpage.org.com:8080,https://myinternalwebpage.org.com`.
 
To enable support for a [preflight OPTIONS request](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-27606):
1. Add the `rest.cors.optionsRequest.allowUnauthorized=true` [internal property](configuring-teamcity-server-startup-properties.md#TeamCity+internal+properties).
2. __Restart__ the TeamCity server.
3. Use the `/app/rest/latest` URL for the requests.  Do not use `/app/rest`, do not use the `httpAuth` prefix.
If that does not help, enable debug [logging](#Logging) and look for related messages. If there are none, capture the browser traffic and messages to investigate the case.
 
### API Client Recommendations
 
When developing a client using the REST API, consider the following recommendations:
* Make the root REST API URL configurable (e.g. allow specifying an alternative for `app/rest/<version>` part of the URL). This will allow directing the client to another version of the API if necessary.
* Ignore (do not error out) item's attributes and sub\-items which are unknown to the client. New sub\-items are sometimes added to the API without version change and this will ensure the client is not affected by the change.
* Set large (and make them configurable) request timeouts. Some API calls can take minutes, especially on a large server.
* Use HTTP sessions to make consecutive requests (use TCSESSIONID cookie returned from the first authenticated response instead of supplying raw credentials all the time). This saves time on authentication which can be significant for external authentication providers.
* Beware of partial answers when requesting list of items: some requests are paged by default. Value of the `count` attribute in the response indicate the number of the items on the current page and there can be more pages available. If you need to process more (or all) items, read and process the `nextHref` attribute of the response entity for items collections. If the attribute is present it means there might be more items when queried by the URL provided. Related locator dimensions are `count` (page limit) and `lookupLimit` (depth of search). Even when the returned `count` is 0, it does not mean there are no more items if there is the "nextHref" attribute present.
* Do not increase the  `lookupLimit` value in the locators without a second thought. Doing so has the direct effect of loading the server more and may require increased amounts of CPU and memory. It is assumed that those increasing the default limit understand the negative consequences for the server performance.
* Do not abuse the ability to execute automated requests for TeamCity API: do not query the API too frequently and restrict the data requested to only that necessary (using due [locators](#Locator) and specifying necessary [fields](#Full+and+Partial+Responses)). Check the server behavior under load from your requests. Make sure not to repeat the request frequently if it takes time to process the request.

### VCS Roots
 
List all VCS roots: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-roots`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-roots).
 
Add the `locator=<vcsRootLocator>` parameter to list only the matched VCS roots.
 
Get details of a VCS root/delete a VCS root: `GET/DELETE` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-roots/<vcsRootLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-roots/<vcsRootLocator>), where `<vcsRootLocator>` can be `id:<internal VCS root id>` or other VCS root locator.
 
Create a new VCS root: `POST VCS root XML` (similar to the one retrieved by a GET request for VCS root details) to [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-roots`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-roots).
 
Also supported:
 
* `GET/PUT` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-roots/<vcsRootLocator>/properties/<property_name>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-roots/<vcsRootLocator>/properties/<property_name>)
* `GET/PUT` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-roots/<vcsRootLocator>/<field_name>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-roots/<vcsRootLocator>/<field_name>)
 
where `<field_name>` is `id`, `name`, `project` (post the project locator to `project` to associate a VCS root with a specific project).
 
List __VCS root instances__: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-root-instances?locator=<vcsRootInstancesLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-root-instances?locator=<vcsRootInstancesLocator>).
 
A ['VCS root'](vcs-root.md) is the setting configured in the TeamCity UI, a "VCS root instance" is an internal TeamCity entity which is derived from the "VCS root" to perform the actual VCS operation. If a VCS root has no %\-references to parameters, a single VCS root corresponds to a single "VCS root instance". If a VCS root has %\-reference to a parameter and the reference resolves to a different value when the VCS root is attached to different configurations or when custom builds are run, a single "VCS root" can generate several "VCS root instances".
 
 __Since TeamCity 10.0__:
 
There are two endpoints dedicated to being used in [commit hooks](configuring-vcs-post-commit-hooks-for-teamcity.md) from the version control repositories: `POST` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-root-instances/checkingForChangesQueue?locator=<vcsRootInstancesLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-root-instances/checkingForChangesQueue?locator=<vcsRootInstancesLocator>)
 
It schedules checking for changes for the matched VCS root instances and returns the list of VCS root instances matched (just like `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-root-instances?locator=<vcsRootInstancesLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-root-instances?locator=<vcsRootInstancesLocator>)): `POST` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-root-instances/commitHookNotification?locator=<vcsRootInstancesLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/vcs-root-instances/commitHookNotification?locator=<vcsRootInstancesLocator>)
 
It schedules checking for changes for the matched VCS root instances and returns plain\-text human\-readable message on the action performed, HTTP response 202 in case of successful operation.
 
Both perform the same action (put the VCS root instances matched by the `<locator>`) to the queue for "checking for changes" process and differ only in responses they produce.
 
Note that since the matched VCS root instances are the same as for `../app/rest/vcs-root-instances?locator=<locator>` request and that means that by default __only the first 100 are matched__ and the rest are ignored. If this limit is reached, consider tweaking the `<locator>` to match fewer instances (recommended) or increase the limit, for example by adding "`,count:1000`" to the locator.
 
#### VCS root instance locator
 
Some supported `<vcsRootInstancesLocator>` from above:
* `type:<VCS root type>` – VCS root instances of the specified version control (for example, "jetbrains.git", "mercurial", "svn").
* `vcsRoot:(<vcsRootLocator>)` – VCS root instances corresponding to the VCS root matched by `<vcsRootLocator>`.
* `buildType:(<buildTypeLocator>)` – VCS root instances attached to the matching build configuration.
* `property:(name:<name>,value:<value>,matchType:<matching>)` – VCS root instances with the property of name `<name>` and value matching condition `<matchType>` (for example, equals, contains) by the value `<value>`.
 
### Build Configuration And Template Settings
 
Build Configuration/Template details: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<buildConfigurationLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<buildConfigurationLocator>).
 
See details on the [Build Configuration Locator](#Build+Configuration+Locator).
 
Note that there is no transaction, for example support for settings editing in TeamCity, so all the settings modified via REST API are taken into account at once. This can result in half\-configured builds triggered and other issues. Make sure you pause a build configuration before changing its settings if this aspect is important for your case.
 
To get aggregated status for several build configurations, see [Build Status Icon](#Build+Status+Icon)  section.
 
Get/set paused build configuration state: `GET/PUT` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<buildTypeLocator>/paused`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<buildTypeLocator>/paused) (put "true" or "false" text as text/plain).
 
Build configuration settings: `GET/DELETE/PUT` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<buildTypeLocator>/settings/<setting_name>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<buildTypeLocator>/settings/<setting_name>).
 
Build configuration parameters: `GET/DELETE/PUT` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<buildTypeLocator>/parameters/<parameter_name>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<buildTypeLocator>/parameters/<parameter_name>).
 
It produces XML, JSON, and plain text depending on the "Accept" header, accepts plain text, XML, and JSON. The `.../parameters/<parameter_name>/name` and `.../parameters/<parameter_name>/value` requests are also supported.
 
Build configuration steps: `GET/DELETE` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<buildTypeLocator>/steps/<step_id>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<buildTypeLocator>/steps/<step_id>).
 
Create build configuration step: `POST` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<buildTypeLocator>/steps`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<buildTypeLocator>/steps).
 
The XML/JSON posted is the same as retrieved by GET request to `.../steps/<step_id>` except for the secure settings like password: these are not included into responses and should be supplied before POSTing back.

#### Build Configuration Locator
 
The most frequently used values for `<buildTypeLocator>` are `id:<buildConfigurationOrTemplate_id>` and `name:<Build%20Configuration%20name>`.
 
__Since TeamCity 2017.2__, the _experimental_ [type](build-configuration.md#Build+Configuration+Types) locator is supported with one of the values: `regular`, `composite`, or `deployment`
 
Other supported [dimensions](#Locator) are (these are in _experimental_ state):
* `internalId` – internal ID of the build configuration.
* `project` – `<projectLocator>` to limit the build configurations to those belonging to a single project.
* `affectedProject` – `<projectLocator>` to limit the build configurations under a single project (recursively).
* `template` – `<buildTypeLocator>` of a template to list only build configurations using the template.
* `templateFlag` – boolean value to get only templates or only non\-templates.
* `paused` – boolean value to filter paused/not paused build configurations.

### Build Requests
 
List builds: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/?locator=<buildLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/?locator=<buildLocator>).
 
Get details of a specific build: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>).
 
Also supports `DELETE` to delete a build.
 
Get the list of build configurations in a project with the status of the last finished build in each build configuration:
 
```Shell
GET http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes?locator=affectedProject:(id:ProjectId)&fields=buildType(id,name,builds($locator(running:false,canceled:false,count:1),build(number,status,statusText)))
 
```
 
#### Build Locator
 
Using a [locator](#Locator) in build\-related requests, you can filter the builds to be returned in the build\-related requests. It is referred to as "build locator" in the scope of REST API.
 
For some requests, a default filtering is applied which returns only "normal" builds (finished builds which are not canceled, not failed\-to\-start, not personal, and on default branch (in branched build configurations)), unless those types of builds are specifically requested via the locator. To turn off this default filter and process all builds, add the `defaultFilter:false` dimension to the build locator. Default filtering varies depending on the specified locator dimensions. For example, when `agent` or `user` dimensions are present, personal, canceled, and failed to start builds are included into the results.
 
Examples of supported build locators:
* `id:<internal build id>` – use [internal build ID](working-with-build-results.md#Internal+Build+ID) when you need to refer to a specific build.
* `number:<build number>` – to find build by build number, provided build configuration is already specified.
* `<dimension1>:<value1>,<dimension2>:<value2>` – to find builds by multiple criteria.
 
The list of supported build locator dimensions:
 
* `project:<project locator>` – limit the list to the builds of the specified project (belonging to any build type directly under the project).
* `affectedProject:<project locator>` – limit the list to the builds of the specified project (belonging to any build type directly or indirectly under the project)
* `buildType:(<buildTypeLocator>),defaultFilter:false` – all the builds of the specified build configuration
* `tag:<tag>` – __since TeamCity 10__, get tagged builds. If a list of tags is specified, for example `tag:<tag1>`, `tag:<tag2>`, only the builds containing all the specified tags are returned. The legacy `tags:<tags>` locator is supported for compatibility.
* `status:<SUCCESS/FAILURE/ERROR>` – list builds with the specified status only.
* `user:(<userLocator>)` – limit builds to only those triggered by the user specified.
* `personal:<true/false/any>` – limit builds by the personal flag. By default, personal builds are not included.
* `canceled:<true/false/any>` – limit builds by the canceled flag. By default, canceled builds are not included.
* `failedToStart:<true/false/any>` – limit builds by the failed to start flag. By default, canceled builds are not included.
* `state:<queued/running/finished>` – limit builds by the specified state.
* `running:<true/false/any>` – limit builds by the running flag. By default, running builds are not included.
* `state:running,hanging:true` – fetch hanging builds (__since TeamCity 10.0__).
* `pinned:<true/false/any>` – limit builds by the pinned flag.
* `branch:<branch locator>` – limit the builds by branch. `<branch locator>` can be the branch name displayed in the UI, or `(name:<name>,default:<true/false/any>,unspecified:<true/false/any>,branched:<true/false/any>`). By default only builds from the default branch are returned. To retrieve all builds, add the following `locator: branch:default:any`. The whole path will look like this: `/app/rest/builds/?locator=buildType:One_Git,branch:default:any`.
* `revision:<REVISION>` – find builds by revision, for example all builds of the given build configuration with the revision: `/app/rest/builds?locator=revision:(REVISION),buildType:(id:BUILD_TYPE_ID)`. See more information [below](#Revisions).
* `agentName:<name>` – agent name to return only builds ran on the agent with the specified name.
* `sinceBuild:(<buildLocator>)` – limit the list of builds only to those after the one specified
* `sinceDate:<date>` – limit the list of builds only to those started after the date specified. The date should be in the same format as dates returned by REST API (for example, `20130305T170030+0400`).
* `queuedDate/startDate/finishDate:(date:<time-date>,build:<build locator>,condition:<before/after>)` – filter builds based on the time specified by the build locator, for example for the builds finished after November 23, 2017, 20:34:46, GMT\+1 timezone use: `finishDate:(date:20171123T203446%2B0100,condition:after)`.
* `count:<number>` – serve only the specified number of builds.
* `start:<number>` – list the builds from the list starting from the position specified (zero\-based).
* `lookupLimit:<number>` – limit processing to the latest N builds only (the default is 5000). If none of the latest N builds match the other specified criteria of the build locator, 404 response is returned for single build request and empty collection for multiple builds request. See related note in the [section above](#API+Client+Recommendations).
 
#### Queued Builds
 
`GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue)

 
Supported locators:
* `project:<locator>`
* `buildType:<locator>`
 
Get details of a queued build: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue/id:XXX`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue/id:XXX).
 
For queued builds with snapshot dependencies, the revisions are available in the `revisions` element of the queued build node if a revision is fixed (for regular builds without snapshot dependencies it is not).
 
Get compatible agents for queued builds (useful for builds having "No agents" to run on): `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue/id:XXX/compatibleAgents`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue/id:XXX/compatibleAgents).
 
__Examples__:
 
List queued builds per project: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue?locator=project:<locator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue?locator=project:<locator>).
 
List queued builds per build configuration: `GET`  [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue?locator=buildType:<locator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue?locator=buildType:<locator>).
 
#### Triggering a Build
 
To start a build, send a `POST` request to [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue) with the "build" node (see below) in content – the same node as details of a queued build or finished build. The queued build details will be returned.
 
When the build is started, the request to the queued build (`/app/rest/buildQueue/XXX`) will return running/finished build data. This way, you can monitor the build completeness by querying build details using the `href` attribute of the build details returned on build triggering, until the build has the `state="finished"` attribute.
 
##### Build node example
 
Basic build for a build configuration:
 
```HTML
<build>
    <buildType id="buildConfID"/>
</build>
 
```
 
Build for a branch marked as personal with a fixed agent, comment and a custom parameter:
 
```HTML
<build personal="true" branchName="logicBuildBranch">
    <buildType id="buildConfID"/>
    <agent id="3"/>
    <comment><text>build triggering comment</text></comment>
    <properties>
        <property name="env.myEnv" value="bbb"/>
    </properties>
</build>
 
```
 
Queued build assignment to an agent pool:
 
```HTML
<build>...
  <agent>
    <pool id="N"/>
  </agent>
...
</build>
 
```
 
Build on a change of given revision, forced rebuild of all dependencies and clean sources before the build, moved to the build queue top on triggering. (Note that the change should be already known to TeamCity (displayed in UI for the build configuration, more on the ["lastChanges" element](#Changes)):
 
```HTML
<build>
  <triggeringOptions cleanSources="true" rebuildAllDependencies="true" queueAtTop="true"/>
  <buildType id="buildConfID"/>
   <lastChanges>
    <change locator="version:a286767fc1154b0c2b93d5728dd5bbcdefdfaca,buildType:(id:buildConfID)"/>
  </lastChanges>
</build>
 
```
 
Example command line for the build triggering:
 
```Shell
curl -v -u user:password http://teamcity.server.url:8111/app/rest/buildQueue --request POST --header "Content-Type:application/xml" --data-binary @build.xml
 
```
 
#### Build Tags
 
Get tags: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/tags/`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/tags/).
 
Replace tags: `PUT` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/tags/`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/tags/) (put the same XML or JSON as returned by GET).
 
Add tags: `POST` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/tags/`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/tags/) (post the same XML or JSON as returned by GET or just a plain\-text tag name; `<buildLocator>` here should match a single build only).
 
#### Build Pinning
 
Get current pin status: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/pin/`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/pin/) (returns "true" or "false" text).
 
Pin: `PUT` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/pin/`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/pin/) (the text in the request data is added as a comment for the action).
 
Unpin: `DELETE` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/pin/`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/pin/) (the text in the request data is added as a comment for the action; `<buildLocator>` here should match a single build only).
 
#### Build Canceling/Stopping
 
Cancel a running or a queued build: POST the `<buildCancelRequest comment='CommentText' readdIntoQueue='false'/>` item to the URL of a running or a queued build. Example:
 
```Shell
curl -v -u user:password --request POST "http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildQueue/<buildLocator>" --data "<buildCancelRequest comment='' readdIntoQueue='false' />" --header "Content-Type: application/xml"
 
```
 
Stop a running build and read it to the queue: POST the `<buildCancelRequest comment='CommentText' readdIntoQueue='true' />` item to the URL of a running build. Example:
 
```Shell
curl -v -u user:password --request POST "http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>" --data "<buildCancelRequest comment='' readdIntoQueue='true' />" --header "Content-Type: application/xml"
 
```
 
See the `canceledInfo` element of the build item (available via `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>)).
 
#### Build Artifacts
 
Return the content of a build artifact file for a build determined by [`<build_locator>`](#Build+Locator): `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<build_locator>/artifacts/content/<path>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<build_locator>/artifacts/content/<path>). `<path>` can be empty for the root of build's artifacts or be a path within the build's artifacts. The path can span into the archive content, for example, `dir/path/archive.zip!/path_within_archive`.
 
* Media\-Type: application/octet\-stream or a more specific media type (determined from artifact file extension).
* Possible error: 400 if the specified path references a directory.
 
Return information about a build artifact: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<build_locator>/artifacts/metadata/<path>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<build_locator>/artifacts/metadata/<path>).
 
* Media\-Type: application/xml or application/json.
 
Return the list of artifact children for directories and archives: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<build_locator>/artifacts/children/<path>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<build_locator>/artifacts/children/<path>).
 
* Media\-Type: application/xml or application/json.
* Possible error: 400 if the artifact is neither a directory nor an archive.
 
Return an archive containing the list of artifacts under the path specified: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<build_locator>/artifacts/archived/<path>?locator=pattern:<wildcard>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<build_locator>/artifacts/archived/<path>?locator=pattern:<wildcard>). The optional `locator` parameter can have file `<wildcard>` to limit the files only to those matching the [wildcard](wildcards.md). `<artifact relative name>` supports referencing files under archives using the `!/` delimiter after the archive name.
 
* Media\-Type: application/zip.
* Possible error: 400 if the artifact is neither a directory nor an archive.

__Examples__:
 
```Shell
GET http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/id:100/artifacts/children/my-great-tool-0.1.jar!/META-INF
GET http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:Build_Intallers),status:SUCCESS/artifacts/metadata/my-great-tool-0.1.jar!/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
GET http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:Build_Intallers),number:16.7.0.2/artifacts/metadata/my-great-tool-0.1.jar!/lib/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar!/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
GET http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:Build_Intallers),tag:release/artifacts/content/my-great-tool-0.1.jar!/lib/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar!/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
    
```
 
##### Authentication
 
If you download artifacts from within a TeamCity build, consider [using](#REST+Authentication) values of `teamcity.auth.userId/teamcity.auth.password` system properties as credentials for the download artifacts request: this way TeamCity will have a way to record that one build used artifacts of another and will display it on the build's __Dependencies__ tab.
 
#### Other Build Requests
 
##### Changes
 
`<changes>` is meant to represent changes the same way as displayed in the build's [Changes](working-with-build-results.md#Changes) in TeamCity UI. In the most cases these are the commits between the current and previous build. The `<changes>` tag is not included into the build by default, it has the href attribute only. If you execute the request specified in the href, you'll get the required changes.
 
Get the list of all changes included into the build: `GET http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/changes?locator=build:(id:<buildId>)`.
 
Get details of an individual change: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/changes/id:changeId`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/changes/id:changeId).
 
Get information about a changed file action: the files node lists changed files. The information about the changed file action is reported via the `changeType` attribute for the files listed as one of the following: `added`, `edited`, `removed`, `copied` or `unchanged`.
 
Filter all changes by a locator: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/changes?locator=<changeLocator>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/changes?locator=<changeLocator>).
 
Note that the change ID is the change's internal ID, not the revision. The ID can be seen in the change node listed by the REST API or in the URL of the change details (as `modId`).
 
Get all changes for a project: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/changes?locator=project:projectId`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/changes?locator=project:projectId).
 
Get all the changes in a build configuration since a particular change identified by its ID: `http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/changes?locator=buildType:(id:buildConfigurationId),sinceChange:(id:changeId)`.
 
Get pending changes for a build configuration: `http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/changes?locator=buildType:(id:BUILD_CONF_ID),pending:true`.
 
The `<lastChanges>` tag contains information about the last commit included into the build. When triggering a build, its nested `<change>` element can contain the `locator` field that specifies what change to use for the build triggering.
 
 
##### Revisions
 
The `<revisions>` tag the same as revisions table on the build's [Changes](working-with-build-results.md#Changes) tab in TeamCity UI: it lists the revisions of all VCS repositories associated with this build that will be checked out by the build on the agent. A revision might or might not correspond to a change known to TeamCity. For example, for a newly created build configuration and a VCS root, a revision will have no corresponding change.
 
Get all builds with the specified revision: `http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds?locator=revision(version:XXXX)`.
 
__Since TeamCity 10__,`<versionedSettingsRevision>` is added to represent revision of the [versioned settings](storing-project-settings-in-version-control.md) of the build.
 
##### Snapshot dependencies
 
It is possible to retrieve the entire build chain (all snapshot\-dependency\-linked builds) for a particular build:
 
```Shell
http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds?locator=snapshotDependency:(to:(id:XXXX),includeInitial:true),defaultFilter:false`
 
```
 
This gets all the snapshot dependency builds recursively for the build with ID XXXX.
 
It possible to find all the snapshot\-dependent builds for a particular build:
 
```Shell
http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds?locator=snapshotDependency:(to:(id:XXXX),includeInitial:true),defaultFilter:false`
 
```
 
##### Artifact dependencies
 
__Since TeamCity 10.0.3__, there is an experimental ability to:
 
Get all the builds which downloaded artifacts from the build with the given ID (Delivered artifacts in the TeamCity Web UI): `GET http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds?locator=artifactDependency:(from:(id:<build ID>),recursive:false)`.
 
Get all the builds whose artifacts were downloaded by the build with the given ID (Downloaded artifacts in the TeamCity Web UI): `GET http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds?locator=artifactDependency:(to:(id:<build ID>),recursive:false)`.
 
 
##### Build Parameters
 
Get the [parameters](predefined-build-parameters.md) of a build: [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/resulting-properties`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/id:<build_id>/resulting-properties).
 
##### Build Fields
 
Get single build's field: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/<field_name>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/<field_name>). This accepts/produces text/plain where `<field_name>` is one of `number`, `status`, `id`, `branchName`, and other build's bean attributes.
 
##### Statistics
 
Get statistics for a single build: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/statistics/`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/statistics/).
Only standard/bundled statistic values are listed. See also [Custom Charts](custom-chart.md).
 
Get single build statistics value: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/statistics/<value_name>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/statistics/<value_name>).
 
Get statistics for a list of builds:
 
```Shell
GET http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds?locator=BUILDS_LOCATOR&fields=build(id,number,status,buildType(id,name,projectName),statistics(property(name,value)))`
 
```

## Other
 
### Data Backup
 
Start backup:
 
```Shell
POST http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/backup?includeConfigs=true&includeDatabase=true&includeBuildLogs=true&fileName=
 
```
 
where `<fileName>` is the prefix of the file to save backup to. The file will be created in the default backup directory (see [more](creating-backup-from-teamcity-web-ui.md)). Get current backup status (idle/running): `GET`  [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/backup`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/backup).
 
### Typed Parameters Specification
 
List [typed parameters](typed-parameters.md):
* For a project: [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/projects/<locator>/parameters`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/projects/<locator>/parameters)
* For a build configuration: [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<locator>/parameters`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<locator>/parameters)
 
The information returned is: `parameters count`, `property name`, `value`, and `type`. The `rawValue` of the `type` element is the [parameter specification](typed-parameters.md#Adding+Parameter+Specification) as defined in the UI.
 
Get details of a specific parameter: `GET` to [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<locator>/parameters/<name>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<locator>/parameters/<name>).
 
Accepts/returns plain\-text, XML, JSON. Supply [the relevant Content-Type header](#Response+Formats) to the request.
 
Create a new parameter: `POST` the same XML or JSON or just plain\-text as returned by `GET` to [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<locator>/parameters/`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<locator>/parameters/). Note that [secure parameters](typed-parameters.md), for example `type=password`, are listed, but the values not included into response, so the result should be amended before POSTing back.
 
__Since TeamCity 9.1__, partial updates of a parameter are possible (currently in an experimental state):
 
* Name: `PUT` the same XML or JSON as returned by `GET` to [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<locator>/parameters/NAME`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<locator>/parameters/NAME)
* Type: `GET/PUT` accepting XML and JSON as returned by `GET` to the URL [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<locator>/parameters/NAME/type`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<locator>/parameters/NAME/type)
* Type's rawValue: `GET/PUT` accepting plain text [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<locator>/parameters/NAME/type/rawValue`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/buildTypes/<locator>/parameters/NAME/type/rawValue)
 
### Build Status Icon
 
Icon that represents a build status:
 
* An .svg icon (__recommended__): `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/statusIcon.svg`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/statusIcon.svg)
* A .png icon: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/statusIcon`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/<buildLocator>/statusIcon)
* Icon that represents build status for several builds (__since TeamCity 10.0__): `GET` request and `strob` build locator dimension.
 
__Example request__:
 
For project with the `PROJECT_ID` ID:
```Shell
GET http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/aggregated/strob:(buildType:(project:(id:PROJECT_ID)))/statusIcon.svg
 
```
 
For all active branches in a build configuration with the `BUILD_CONF_ID` ID:
```Shell
GET http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/aggregated/strob:(branch:(buildType:(id:BUILD_CONF_ID),policy:active_history_and_active_vcs_branches),locator:(buildType:(id:BUILD_CONF_ID)))/statusIcon.svg
 
```
 
For request `/app/rest/builds/aggregated/<build locator>` the status is calculated by list of the builds: `app/rest/builds?locator=<build locator>`. This allows embedding a build status icon into any HTML page with a simple `img` tag:
 
For build configuration with the internal `btXXX` ID:
 
Status of the last build:
 
```HTML
<img src="http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:btXXX)/statusIcon"/>
 
```
 
Status of the last build tagged with the `myTag` tag:
```HTML
<img src="http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:btXXX),tag:myTag/statusIcon"/>
 
```
 
![BuildSuccessfulStatus.png](BuildSuccessfulStatus.png)
 
All other [build locators](#Build+Locator) are supported.
 
For example, you can use the following markdown markup to add the build status for GitHub repository for the build configuration with ID `TeamCityPluginsByJetBrains_TeamcityGoogleTagManagerPlugin_Build` and server [`https://teamcity.jetbrains.com`](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com) with guest authentication enabled:
 
```HTML
[![Build status](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/guestAuth/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:TeamCityPluginsByJetBrains_TeamcityGoogleTagManagerPlugin_Build)/statusIcon.svg)](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=TeamCityPluginsByJetBrains_TeamcityGoogleTagManagerPlugin_Build)
 
```
 
If the returned image contains "no permission to get data" text (![no-permission-to-get-data.png](no-permission-to-get-data.png)), ensure that one of the following is true:
* The server has the [guest user access](guest-user.md) enabled, and the guest user has permissions to access the build configuration referenced, or
* The build configuration referenced has the "enable status widget" [option](configuring-general-settings.md#Enable+Status+Widget) __ON__.
* You are logged in to the TeamCity server in the same browser and you have permissions to view the build configuration referenced. Note that this will not help for embedded images in GitHub pages as GitHub retrieves the images from the server side.
 
### TeamCity Licensing Information Requests
 
__Since TeamCity 10__:
 
Licensing information: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/licensingData`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/licensingData).
 
List of license keys: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/licensingData/licenseKeys`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/licensingData/licenseKeys).
 
License key details: `GET` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/licensingData/licenseKeys/<license_key>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/licensingData/licenseKeys/<license_key>).
 
Add license key(s): `POST` text/plain newline-delimited keys to [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/licensingData/licenseKeys`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/licensingData/licenseKeys).
 
Delete a license key: `DELETE` [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/licensingData/licenseKeys/<license_key>`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/server/licensingData/licenseKeys/<license_key>).
 
### CCTray
 
CCTray\-compatible XML is available via [`http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/cctray/projects.xml`](http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/cctray/projects.xml).
 
Without authentication (only build configurations available for guest user): [`http://teamcity:8111/guestAuth/app/rest/cctray/projects.xml`](http://teamcity:8111/guestAuth/app/rest/cctray/projects.xml).
 
The CCTray\-format XML does not include paused build configurations by default. The URL accepts the `locator` parameter instead with standard [build configuration locator](#Build+Configuration+Locator).
 
## Request Examples
 
### Request Sending Tool
 
You can use [curl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) command line tool to interact with the TeamCity REST API.
 
Example command:
```Shell
curl -v --basic --user USERNAME:PASSWORD --request POST "http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/users/" --data @data.xml --header "Content-Type: application/xml"
 
```
where `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, `teamcity:8111` are to be substituted with real values, and `data.xml` file contains the data to send to the server.
 
 
#### Creating a new project
 
Using curl tool:
 
```Shell
curl -v -u USER:PASSWORD http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/projects --header "Content-Type: application/xml" --data-binary
"<newProjectDescription name='New Project Name' id='newProjectId'><parentProject locator='id:project1'/></newProjectDescription>"
 
```
 
#### Making user a system administrator
 
1. Get [super user](super-user.md) token.
2. Issue the request.
3. Get [curl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) command line tool and use a command line:
 
```Shell
curl -v -u :SUPERUSER_TOKEN --request PUT http://teamcity:8111/app/rest/users/username:USERNAME/roles/SYSTEM_ADMIN/g/
 
```
where `SUPERUSER_TOKEN` is the super user token unique for each server start; `teamcity:8111` – the TeamCity server URL; `USERNAME` – the username of the user to be made the system administrator.
