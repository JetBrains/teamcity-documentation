The Windows Tray Notifier is an utility which allows monitoring the status of specific build configurations in the system tray via popup alerts and status icons.

## Installing Windows Tray Notifier

To install the Windows Tray Notifier:
1. In the top right corner of the TeamCity web UI, click the arrow next to your username, and select __My Settings &amp; Tools__.
2. In the __TeamCity Tools__ area, click the __download__ link under __Windows tray notifier__.
3. Run the TrayNotifierInstaller.msi file and follow the instructions.

## Configuring Windows Tray Notifier

To launch Windows Tray Notifier, run the __Start &gt; Programs &gt; JetBrains TeamCity Tray Notifier__ menu.

When the application started, you need to connect and log in to your server:
1. Specify your TeamCity server URL and credentials to log in to it.
2. Wait for the notifier to connect to your TeamCity server. Once the connection is established, you'll be prompted to configure notification rules in the __My Settings &amp; Tools | Notification rules | Windows Tray Notifier__ section: <img src="windows-tray-notifier.png" width="750" alt="Windows Tray Notifier"/>
3. When Windows Tray Notifier is launched, the [status icon](#Status+Icons) in the Windows System Tray appears.

## Windows Tray Notifier UI

### Status Icons

After you have launched Windows Tray Notifier and specified your TeamCity username and password, the Notifier icon showing the state of your projects and build configurations appears in Windows System Tray.

If you have no projects and build configurations to monitor, the icon represents a question mark. After you have configured a list of build configurations and projects and their state changes, the status icon changes to reflect the change as well. The table below represents these possible states.

<table><tr>

</td></tr></table>

<note>

The Notifier icon always shows the status of the _last completed build_ of your watched project or build configurations, unless you select to be notified when __the first build error occurs__ option on the __Windows Tray Notifier settings__ page. In this case, the notifier does not wait for the failing build to finish, and it displays a failed build icon as soon as the running build fails a test.
