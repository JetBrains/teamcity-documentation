[//]: # (title: Subscribing to Notifications)
[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Subscribing to Notifications)
TeamCity provides a wide range of notification possibilities to keep developers informed about the status of their projects. Notifications can be sent by email, Jabber/XMPP instant messages or can be displayed in the IDE (with the help of TeamCity plugins) or the Windows system tray (using TeamCity Windows Tray Notifier). Notifications can also be received via Atom/RSS syndication feeds.

Notifications in TeamCity are sent per\-user according to the user's configured notification rules. Notification rules can also be configured at the user group level, in which case they will apply to all the users in the group.

You can [customize](customizing-notifications.md) notification templates.

## Subscribing to Notifications

TeamCity allows you to flexibly adjust the notification rules, so that you receive notifications only on the events you are interested in. To subscribe to notifications:

1\. In the top right corner of the screen, click the arrow next to your username, and select __My Settings &amp; Tools__ from the drop-down menu. Open the __Notification Rules__ tab.

2\. Click the required notifications type: 
 * __Email Notifier__: to be able to receive email notifications, your email address must be specified in the __General__ area on the __My Settings &amp; Tools__ page.

<tip>

Note that TeamCity comes with a default notification rule. It will send you an email notification if a build with your changes has failed. This rule starts working after you enter the email address.
</tip>

 * __IDE Notifier__: to receive notifications right in your IDE, the required TeamCity plugin must be installed in your IDE. For the details on installing TeamCity IDE plugins, refer to [Installing Tools](installing-tools.md).
 * __Jabber Notifier__: to receive notifications of this type, specify your Jabber account either on the __Notification Rules | Jabber notifier__ page, or the __My Settings &amp; Tools__ page in the __Watched Builds and Notifications__ area. Note that instead of Jabber you can specify your Google Talk account here if this option is configured by the System Administrator.
 * __Windows Tray Notifier__: to receive this type of notifications, [Windows Tray Notifier](windows-tray-notifier.md) must be installed.

3\. Click __Add new rule__ and specify the rule in the dialog. The notification rules are comprised of two parts: [what you will watch](#What+Will+Be+Watched) and [which events you will be notified about](#Which+Events+Will+Trigger+Notifications). See the details below.

<note>

Email and Jabber notifications are sent only if the System Administrator has configured the TeamCity server email and Jabber settings. System Administrators can also [change the templates](customizing-notifications.md) used for notifications.

### What Will Be Watched

<table>

<tr><td></td><td></td></tr>


<tr>

<td>

Events related to the following projects and build configurations

</td>

<td>

Select the projects / build configurations whose builds you want to monitor. Notification rules defined for a project will be propagated to its subprojects. To monitor all of the builds of all the projects' build configurations, select __Root project__. 

Use the following options for granular control over the notifications in the selected projects / build configurations:

* __Branch filter__ – select this option to receive alerts only on the builds from the specified branches. Read more in [Branch Filter](branch-filter.md).
* __Builds with my changes only__ – select this option to limit notifications to builds containing your changes only. 

<note>

Make sure your [Version Control Username](managing-users-and-user-groups.md#VCS+Usernames) Settings are correct.
</note>

* __My favorite builds only__ – limit notifications to your [favorite builds](favorite-build.md).

### Which Events Will Trigger Notifications

<table>

<tr><td></td><td></td></tr>


<tr>

<td>

__Build fails__

</td>

<td>

Check this option to receive notifications about all of _finished_ failed builds in the specified projects and build configurations. If an investigation for a build configuration was assigned to someone _while the build was in progress_, the failed build notification is sent only to that user.

Note that if __Builds with my changes only__ is selected in the __Watch__ area, TeamCity will notify you if a build with your changes fails, and will keep sending notifications on each 'incomplete' build afterwards until a successful one. An incomplete build is a finished build which failed with at least one of the following errors: 

* Execution timeout

* JVM crashed

* JVM Out of memory error

* Unable to collect changes

* Compilation error

* Artifacts publishing failed

* Unknown Failure reason



</td></tr><tr>

<td>

Check this option to receive notifications on changing a build configuration or test investigation status, e.g. someone is investigating the problem, or problems were fixed, or the investigator changed.


</td></tr><tr>

<td>

__Tests are muted or unmuted__


</td>

<td>

Check this option to receive notifications on the test [mute](investigating-and-muting-build-failures.md#Muting+Failed+Tests) status change in the affected build configurations.

__Investigation assigned to me__

This option is available only if the __System wide events__ option is selected in the __Watch__ area. Check the option to be notified each time you start investigating a problem.

## Rules Processing Order
[//]: # (AltHead: processingOrder)

TeamCity applies the notification rules in the order they are presented. TeamCity checks whether a build matches any notification rule, and sends a notification according to _the first matching_ rule; the further check for matching conditions for the same build is not performed. You can reorder the configured notification rules.

The user rules are applied first, then the group rules are applied.

The group rules are processed in hierarchical order: starting from child groups to parent ones.

If there are more than one parent with their own rules set, the inherited rules are processed top\-bottom corresponding to the order they are presented on the Notification Rules user profile tab (alphabetically).

## Unsubscribing and Overriding Existing Rules

You may already have some notification rules configured by your System Administrator for the user group you're included in.
* To unsubscribe from or override group notifications, add your own rule with the same watched builds and different notification events.
* To unsubscribe from all events, add a rule with the corresponding watched builds and no events selected.

## Customizing RSS Feed Notifications

TeamCity allows obtaining information about the finished builds or about the builds with the changes of particular users via RSS. You can customize the RSS feed from the TeamCity Tools sidebar of __My Settings &amp; Tools__ page using the [Syndication Feed](syndication-feed.md) section (click __customize__ to open the __Feed URL Generator__ options) or from the home page of a build configuration. TeamCity produces a URL to the syndication feed on the basis of the values specified on the Feed URL Generator page.
