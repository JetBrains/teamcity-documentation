[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Changing Build Configuration Type)

A TeamCity <tooltip term="build-configuration">_build configuration_</tooltip> can have one of the following types:
* Regular
* [Deployment](deployment-build-configuration.md), which deploys artifacts of other builds to some external environment
* [Composite](composite-build-configuration.md), which aggregates results from several other builds combined by snapshot dependencies and presents them in a single place

You can change a build configuration's type in its __General Settings__.
