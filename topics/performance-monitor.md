[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Performance Monitor)

The _Performance Monitor_ build feature allows you to get the statistics on the CPU, disk, and memory usage during a build run on a build agent.

Performance Monitor supports Windows, Linux, macOS, Solaris, and FreeBSD operating systems. It requires [Perl](https://learn.perl.org/installing/) to be installed on any used OS except Windows.

Note that Performance Monitor reports the load of the whole operating system. It will not report proper results if you have more than one agent running on the same host, or if an agent and a server are installed on the same machine.

<note>

If you run a build agent [as a Windows service](setting-up-and-running-additional-build-agents.md#Build+Agent+as+a+Windows+Service), the user starting the agent must be a member of the _Performance Monitor Users_ group to be able to monitor performance metrics. Users can be added to the group via the `lusrmgr.msc` command.
</note>

After you enable the Performance Monitor [build feature](adding-build-features.md) for a build configuration, the __Build Results__ page of each newly run build in this configuration will contain the __PerfMon__ tab with a graph of performance statistics. The _CPU_ value reflects the average CPU load during the build, the _Disk_ and _Memory_ values are calculated relatively to the total disk space and physical memory available on the agent machine.

Clicking on a point in the graph displays the corresponding value (CPU on a screenshot below) as well as the build log with the highlighted fragment for the selected time:
