The run configuration policy allows you to select the specific build configurations you want a build agent to run. By default, build agents run all compatible build configurations and this isn't always desirable. The run configuration policy settings are located on the __Compatible configurations__ tab of the [Agents Details](viewing-build-agent-details.md) page.
