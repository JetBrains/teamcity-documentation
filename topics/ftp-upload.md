[//]: # (title: FTP Upload)
[//]: # (auxiliary-id: FTP Upload)

The _FTP Upload_ build runner allows deploying files/directories to an FTP server.
 
The settings common for all runners are described in [Configuring Build Steps](configuring-build-steps.md); this page details the FTP Upload settings.

The fields below support [parameter references](predefined-build-parameters.md): any text between percentage signs (`%`) is considered a reference to a property by TeamCity. To prevent TeamCity from treating the text in the percentage signs as a property reference, use two percentage signs to escape them: for example, if you want to pass `%Y%m%d%H%M%S` into the build, change it to `%%Y%%m%%d%%H%%M%%S`.

__Deployment Target__

Target host

</td>

<td>

Specify an FTP server (use a hostname or IP address) and a remote directory (relative to the FTP user's home).

To set an absolute `*nix` path, use `%2F` as the forward slash. For example:

```Shell
ftp://hostname.com/
hostname.com:34445/subdir
127.0.0.1/%2Fetc/
```

Select either _Anonymous_ (will submit username `anonymous` and a single space character as the password) or _username/password_ (for custom credentials).

Transfer Mode

</td>

Optional. Select an FTP transfer mode to force: the ASCII or Binary FTP transfer modes (if the automatically detected mode leads to a broken file transfer).

__Deployment Source__

Paths to sources

</td>

<td>

Specify the deployment sources as a newline- or comma-separated list of paths to files/directories.

The field supports [Ant-style wildcard patterns](wildcards.md#Antlike+Wildcards) (for example, `dir/**/*.zip`).   
You can also specify a target directory to be created using the `file => directory` pattern (for example, `*.zip => winFiles,unix/distro.tgz => linuxFiles` will create the `winFiles` and `linuxFiles` directories, and respectively put the declared files inside them).
