This article describes what actions can be applied to <emphasis tooltip="build">builds</emphasis> in TeamCity.

## Run Build

TeamCity allows running builds:
* Automatically, with various [build triggers](configuring-build-triggers.md).
* Manually, on demand.

To run a build manually, click __Run__ in the upper right corner of the screen. This action is available in both __Build Configuration Settings__ and __Build Configuration Home__ modes. If the __Run__ button does not appear for a certain build configuration, it means you do not have enough permissions to start builds in it.

The context menu next to the __Run__ button opens the build's settings menu, so you can initiate a <emphasis tooltip="custom-build-run">custom build run</emphasis>. A custom run allows using different settings or/and source code than if running a regular build in the current configuration. This is handy if you want to try different build parameters or pretest local code without affecting common build settings or committing the code to the common repository. Read more about this functionality [here](running-custom-build.md).

## Cancel Build

To cancel a running build, click the stop icon next to its progress bar. TeamCity will prompt to you to enter an optional reason for cancelling; you can also choose if this build should be automatically re-added to the queue.

Note that there is no way to pause and then continue a single build (though you can [pause a whole build configuration](changing-build-configuration-status.md)). If cancelled, a build should be restarted from the first step.

## Build Actions Menu

The following actions can be invoked from the single-build __Actions__ menu. To open this menu from __Build Configuration Home__, click ![VCS-browserIcon.png](VCS-browserIcon.png) opposite the build in the list. To open it from the build's __Overview__, click __Actions__ in the upper left corner.

### Re-run Build

This action will restart the current build only, omitting other builds in its <emphasis tooltip="build-chain">chain</emphasis> if any. It might be helpful if the build failed due to certain infrastructure problems.

### Remove Build

This action will delete the build from the list.

### Pin Build

You can pin a build to prevent it from being removed during a scheduled [clean-up](teamcity-data-clean-up.md).

If the current build is a part of a <emphasis tooltip="build-chain">chain</emphasis> and has [snapshot dependencies](snapshot-dependencies.md) on other builds, you can choose to apply this action to all its preceding builds in the chain.

A pinned build can be unpinned manually anytime.

### Add Tags to Build

Build tags are labels that can help:
* Organize the history of your builds.
* Quickly navigate to the builds marked with a specific tag.
* [Search](search.md) for a build with a particular tag.
{instance="tc"}
* Create an [artifact dependency](artifact-dependencies.md) on a build with a particular tag.

In the _Edit tags_ dialog, enter one or more tags separated by space, comma, or semicolon. For example, `v2022 release` will create two tags: `v2022` and `release`.

If you click a certain tag when viewing a build list, this will filter out other builds, so you can focus only on the builds with this tag.

Apart from the __Actions__ menu, you can tag a build in the _[Run Custom Build](running-custom-build.md)_ dialog and in the _Pin Build_ dialog.

You can also add and modify build tags using [service messages](service-messages.md#Adding+and+Removing+Build+Tags) and [TeamCity REST API](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/rest/manage-finished-builds.html#Manage+Build+Tags).

### Add Build to Favorites

<!--[//]: # (Internal note. Do not delete. "Favorite Buildd142e4.txt")-->

You can add builds to _favorites_ to have quick access to them. Favorite builds can also be set as a filter option for [notifications](set-up-notifications.md).

When added to favorites, a build will be marked with a star icon ![star_filled.png](star_filled.png). Clicking it will remove the "favorite" status.

TeamCity can automatically mark your manually triggered and [personal builds](personal-build.md) as favorites. To achieve this, enable the respective setting in your [user profile settings](configuring-your-user-profile.md).

To view your favorites, click your avatar in the upper right corner of the screen and choose __Favorite Builds__.

### Compare Two Builds

The _Select for comparison_ action of the build's __Actions__ menu (in __[Build Results](build-results-page.md)__) is available only in the new TeamCity UI. You can switch to it from a classic UI mode by clicking the magic wand icon in the upper right corner of the screen.

This action allows comparing the settings and results of the current build with any other build from this build configuration, side-by-side. It shows the statistics and differences of their [parameters](configuring-build-parameters.md), revisions, statistics, and tests.

This mode is especially helpful when the current build configuration is managed and monitored by multiple users. For example, if a build has no changes in the project code but fails for no obvious reason, you can compare this build with the last successful build and analyze their differences to find the most probable cause of the failure.

### Manually Change Build Status to Failed or Successful

Project administrators can manually change the successful build's status to failed, and vice versa. There are following common use cases for this:

* **From successful to failed**:
  * The build has some problem which did not affect the final [build status](build-state.md), but you want to reflect the problem's presence in the build history.
  * There is a known problem with the build, and you want this build to be ignored by a QA team.
  * You have previously mistakenly marked the build as successful.
* **From failed to successful**:
  * You need to change the _last successful build_ anchor when using [build failure conditions](build-failure-conditions.md). If your last build failed because of an incorrect value of a metric and this new value is valid, you can mark this build with a _successful_ anchor.
  * You want to allow using an incorrectly failed build with good artifacts in __[Artifact Dependencies](artifact-dependencies.md#Configuring+Artifact+Dependencies+Using+Web+UI)__.
  * For a running [personal build](personal-build.md), you can mark the current failures as non-relevant to allow the pretested commit to pass.

The "_Mark as successful_" action is not available for [builds that failed to start](build-state.md#Failed+to+Start+Builds).

### Label Build Sources

TeamCity can label (tag) sources of a particular build in your VCS repository. The list of applied labels and their application status is displayed on the __[Changes](build-results-page.md#Changes+Tab)__ tab of __Build Results__.

You can configure [automatic labeling](vcs-labeling.md) or label each build manually, from the __Actions__ menu. Manual labeling uses the VCS settings actual for the build.

### Merge Build Sources

TeamCity can merge the code of one source branch to another: for example, after an approved code review.

You can configure [automatic merge](automatic-merge.md) or do it manually for each build, from the __Actions__ menu. The pop-up dialog will prompt you to select the destination branch for a merge and enter a merge commit message.

## Build Configuration Actions Menu

The __[Build Configuration Home](build-configuration-home-page.md)__ page has own __Actions__ menu with a different set of actions. It allows you to:
* [Pause triggers](changing-build-configuration-status.md).
* Check for [pending changes](change-state.md).
* Enforce [clean checkout](clean-checkout.md).
* [Assign an investigation](investigating-and-muting-build-failures.md).
* [Clean stream workspaces on a Perforce server](perforce-workspace-handling-in-teamcity.md#Cleaning+Workspaces+on+Perforce+Server).

## Apply Action to Multiple Builds

You can manage multiple builds at once (for example, pin, add tags, compare two builds, remove builds, add builds to favorites, or add comments). For this, select the required builds on the __Overview__ tab of __Build Configuration Home__ (checkboxes appear when hovering over builds), and use commands of the pop-up context menu. If you need to select a range of builds, press __Shift__ and click build checkboxes at the edges of the range to be selected.
