TeamCity integration with the GitHub issue tracker can be set up separately or as a part of TeamCity integration with the [GitHub source code hosting service](integrating-teamcity-with-vcs-hosting-services.md).

When setting up integration with GitHub (see general information [here](integrating-teamcity-with-issue-tracker.md#Enabling+Issue+Tracker+Integration)), in addition to the repository URL and other general settings, you need to configure authentication and specify the issue ID pattern.

## Authentication

TeamCity allows you to select whether you want to connect to GitHub anonymously or to be authenticated via a personal access token (PAT).
