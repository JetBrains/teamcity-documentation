[//]: # (title: Build Approval)
[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Build Approval)

The _Build Approval_ [build feature](adding-build-features.md) allows users to manually control the build start by using approvals.
This build feature ensures that builds will not start
unless they are approved by individual users or groups defined in the approval rules.

This feature can be useful for processes requiring approval of more than one person, 
for example deployments, resource consuming builds, resource removing operations, etc. 
Approvals also prevent users from triggering a build accidentally. 

If a build is not approved within the specified period of time, it will be cancelled.

## Build Approval Settings

[Add Build Approval](adding-build-features.md) to your build configuration.
 
All builds of this build configuration will require an approval.

Approval rules

</td><td>

* user-based rules require an approval from a specific [user](creating-and-managing-users.md); each user should be specified via the `user:<username>` syntax. Use the list of users separated by a new-line.

* group-based rules require a certain number of approvals from members of a specific [group](creating-and-managing-user-groups.md); each rule should follow the `group:<groupKey>:<approvalCount>` syntax. Use the list of groups separated by a new-line.
>Note that `<groupKey>` is **case-sensitive**.



For example, the rules below will allow a build to start only if it is approved by the `teamlead` user, the `projectadmin` user, and by at least two members of the`QA` group:

```Text
user:teamlead
user:projectadmin
group:QA:2
```

You can specify multiple rules requiring approval from several users and/or groups. In this case, __all__ of the rules must be met for the build to start. 
If a user matches several rules (e.g. a user is a part of multiple groups referenced in the rule), 
the approval from that user will count towards each rule. 
In the example above, if the `teamlead` user is a member of the `QA` group, 
then, when a build is approved by `projectadmin` and `teamlead`, only one more approval from the `QA` group is needed for the build to start.

The period of time (in minutes) before the build will be automatically canceled if not approved. Defaults to 360 minutes (6 hours).

Treat manually started build as approval

</td><td>

If this option is enabled, and a build is triggered by a user who has the right to approve build, the feature will automatically add an approval from this user to this build. If the option is not enabled, the build will still require an explicit approval from the person(s) specified in the rule, regardless of who triggered the build.

## Notifications & Audit

All approvers will receive an e-mail notification: it is included in the in the default [notification rules](adding-notification-rules.md) for the [All Users](creating-and-managing-user-groups.md#allusers) group. Consider adding a related Slack notification. Notifications related to build approval will override the *Builds with my changes only* option in the notification rules.

You can also [add notifications for your build configuration](configuring-notifications.md) using the [Notifications](notifications.md) build feature with the **Build requires approval** option enabled. 

When a build is approved by a user, a corresponding [audit entry](tracking-user-actions.md) is created.
