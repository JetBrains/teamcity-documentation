A _personal build_ is a build-out of the common build sequence which typically uses the changes not yet committed into the version control. Personal builds are usually initiated from one of the [supported IDEs](supported-platforms-and-environments.md#Remote+Run+and+Pre-tested+Commit) via the [Remote Run](remote-run.md) procedure. You can also upload a patch with changes directly to the server, as described [below](#Direct+Patch+Upload).

A personal build uses the current VCS repository sources plus the changed files identified during the remote run initiation. The results of a personal build can be seen in the "My Changes" view of the corresponding IDE plugin and on the __[Changes](viewing-your-changes.md)__ page in TeamCity. Finished personal builds are listed in the [build history](build-history.md), but only for the users who initiated them.   
Read more about running commits via Remote Run in [Pre-Tested (Delayed) Commit](pre-tested-delayed-commit.md).

By default, users only see their own personal builds in the build lists, but this can be changed via the "_Show all personal builds_" option in __My Settings & Tools | General | UI settings__ of the [user profile](managing-your-user-account.md).

You can also mark a build as _personal_ using the corresponding option of the [Run](triggering-a-custom-build.md) dialog.   
By default, only users with the Project Developer [role](role-and-permission.md) can initiate a personal build.

It is possible to [restrict running personal builds](configuring-general-settings.md#Allow+Triggering+Personal+Builds) in the __General Settings__ of a build configuration.

### Direct Patch Upload

You can upload a patch with local changes directly to the TeamCity server, via our web UI or REST API.

TeamCity supports patches in a [unified diff format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format).

<note>

* Since the format varies between tools that can generate unidiff files, we cannot guarantee error-free processing of all unidiff variations. Currently, TeamCity provides a stable parsing of unidiff files generated by IntelliJ Platform IDEs and Git.

* TeamCity does not support binary changes in non-binary files.

</note>

__To generate a patch__:

* __In any IntelliJ Platform IDE__: select the required local changes in the commit log, click [Create Patch](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/use-patches.html#create-patch) in the context menu, and save the patch as a `*.diff` file.
* __Via Git__: run `git diff commit1..commit2 > path/filename.diff`.   
For example, to save a diff between the last commit and the preceding commit to the `patch.diff` file in the `test` folder, run `git diff HEAD^ HEAD > ~/test/patch.diff`. See other examples in [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#_examples).

__To upload a patch and run a personal build via the web UI__:
1. Open the [Run Custom Build](triggering-a-custom-build.md) dialog and enable the "_run as a personal build_" option. The __Upload patch__ button will appear. <img src="upload-patch-ui.png" alt="Upload a unidiff patch via UI" width="500"/>
2. Upload the patch and click __Run Build__.   
The agent will receive the patch and apply it before running the build. After the build, it will revert the patch, so the checkout directory can be reused by subsequent builds.

__To upload a patch and run a personal build via REST API__:

1. Send the following `POST` request:
    ```Shell
    curl \
       -X POST \
       -H "Content-Type: text/text" \
       -H "Origin: <host>:<port>" \
       --data-binary @patch.diff \
       "http://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/uploadDiffChanges.html?description=<description-text>&commitType=0"
   ```
   As a response, you will receive the ID of this change on the server.   
2. Create an XML file that describes the build node and mentions the build configuration ID and the ID of your personal change:
   ```xml
   <build personal="true">
     <triggered type='idePlugin' details='Unified Diff Patch'/>
     <triggeringOptions cleanSources="false" rebuildAllDependencies="false" queueAtTop="false"/>
     <buildType id="<build_configuration_id>"/>
     <lastChanges>
       <change id="<change_ID>" personal="true"/>
     </lastChanges>
   </build>
   ```   
3. To trigger a personal build via REST API, post the created file to the `buildQueue` endpoint:
   ```Shell
    curl \
        -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/xml" \
        -H "Origin: <host>:<port>" \
        --data @node.xml \
        "http://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/app/rest/buildQueue"
   ```   
   The agent will receive the patch and apply it before running the build. After the build, it will revert the patch, so the checkout directory can be reused by subsequent builds.
