TeamCity can authenticate users via an internal database, or can integrate into your system and use external authentication sources such as Windows Domain, LDAP, or Git hosting providers.

## Configuring Authentication

Authentication is configured on the __Administration | Authentication__ page. Currently used authentication modules are also displayed there.

TeamCity provides several preconfigured authentication options (presets) to cover the most common [use cases](#Simple+Mode). The presets are combinations of authentication modules supported by TeamCity:

* [Credentials authentication modules](#Credentials+Authentication+Modules)
  * [Built-in](#Built-in+Authentication)
  * [Windows Domain Authentication](#Windows+Domain+Authentication)
  * [LDAP Integration](ldap-integration.md)
  * [Token-Based Authentication](#Token-Based+Authentication)
* [HTTP authentication modules](#HTTP+Authentication+Modules)
  * [Basic HTTP Authentication](#Basic+HTTP+Authentication)
  * [NTLM HTTP Authentication](ntlm-http-authentication.md)
  * [Bitbucket Cloud](#Bitbucket+Cloud)
  * [GitHub.com](#GitHub.com)
  * [GitHub Enterprise](#GitHub+Enterprise)
  * [GitLab.com](#GitLab.com)
  * [GitLab CE/EE](#GitLab+CE%2FEE)

<tip>

If you are using [JetBrains Hub](https://www.jetbrains.com/hub/), you can configure single sign-on (SSO) from the TeamCity login form and IDE using a [separate plugin for TeamCity](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9156-jetbrains-hub-integration).
</tip>

When you first sign in to TeamCity, the default authentication, including the Built-in and Basic HTTP authentication modules, is enabled and the [simple mode](#Simple+Mode) is active.

* To modify the existing settings, click __Edit__ next to the description of the enabled authentication module.
* To switch to a different preconfigured scheme, use the __Load preset__ button. For more options, switch to the [advanced mode](#Advanced+Mode).

<tip>

Any changes made to authentication in the UI are reflected in the `<[TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md)>/config/auth-config.xml` file. If using the UI is not possible (for example, the server is not started yet), you can configure authentication settings in this file. The detailed instructions are available in the [previous version](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD8/Configuring+Authentication+Settings) of this document.
</tip>

### Simple Mode

The simple mode (default) allows you to select presets created for the most common use cases. To override the existing authentication settings, use the __Load preset__ button, select one of the options, and __Save__ your changes. The following presets are available:
* Default ([built-in authentication](#Built-in+Authentication) â€“ [Token-based](#Token-Based+Authentication) and [Basic HTTP](accessing-server-by-http.md))
* [LDAP](ldap-integration.md)
* Active directory ([LDAP](ldap-integration.md) with [NTLM](ntlm-http-authentication.md) and [Token-based](rest-api-reference.md#User+Access+Tokens))
* Microsoft Windows Domain ([NTLM](ntlm-http-authentication.md), [Token-based](rest-api-reference.md#User+Access+Tokens) and [Basic HTTP](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/rest/teamcity-rest-api-documentation.html#REST+Authentication))

### Advanced Mode

TeamCity allows enabling several authentication modules simultaneously using the advanced mode.

When a user attempts to sign in, modules will be tried one by one. If one of them authenticates the user, the login will be successful; if all of them fail, the user will not be able to sign in to TeamCity.

<warning>

If System Administrator creates users without a password with several authentication modes enabled on the server including the [Built-in](#Built-in+Authentication) one, and later changes authentication from mixed one to the build-in one, users with no password will be unable to sign in to TeamCity.
</warning>

It is possible to use a combination of internal and external authentication. The recommended approach is to configure [LDAP Integration](ldap-integration.md) for your internal employees first and then to add [Built-in](#Built-in+Authentication) authentication for external users.   
Since TeamCity 2020.2, you can also enable authentication via Git hosting providers.

To add a module:
1. Switch to advanced mode with the corresponding link on the __Administration | Authentication__ page.
2. Click __Add Module__ and select a module from the drop-down menu.
3. Use the properties available for modules by selecting checkboxes in the __Add Module__ dialog.
4. Click __Apply__ and __Save__ your changes.

>TeamCity plugins can provide [additional authentication modules](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/teamcity/custom-authentication-module.html).

## User Authentication Settings

The very first time TeamCity server starts with no users (and no administrator), so the first user is prompted for the administrator account. If you are not prompted for the administrator account, refer to [How To Retrieve Administrator Password](how-to.md#Retrieve+Administrator+Password) for a resolution.

The TeamCity administrator can modify the authentication settings of every user on their profile page.

The TeamCity list of users and authentication modules just map external credentials to the users. This means that a single TeamCity user can authenticate using different modules, provided the entered credentials are mapped to the same TeamCity user. Authentication modules have a configuration on how to map external user data to a TeamCity user, and some allow editing the external user linking data on the TeamCity user profile.

Handling of the user mapping by the bundled authentication modules:
* Built-in authentication stores a TeamCity-maintained password for each user.
* Windows Domain authentication allows specifying the default domain and assumes the domain account name is equal to the TeamCity user. The domain account can be edited on the user profile page.
* LDAP Integration allows setting LDAP property to get TeamCity username from user's LDAP entry.
* Modules, corresponding to Git hosting providers, allow admins mapping users with their external accounts by usernames. Each user can connect own profile to an external Git hosting account in __My settings & Tools | General | Authentication Settings__.

Be cautious when modifying authentication settings: there can be a case when the administrator cannot login after changing authentication modules.   
Let's imagine that the administrator had the "jsmith" TeamCity username and used the default authentication. Then, the authentication module was changed to Windows domain authentication (i.e. Windows domain authentication module was added and the default one was removed). If, for example, the Windows domain username of that administrator is "john.smith", they will not able to sign in anymore: they cannot login using the default authentication since it is disabled and cannot login using Windows domain authentication since their Windows domain username is not equal to the TeamCity username. The solution nevertheless is quite simple: the administrator can sign in using the [superuser account](super-user.md) and change their TeamCity username or specify their Windows domain username on their own profile page.

### Special User Accounts

By default, TeamCity has a [Super User](super-user.md) account with maximum permissions and a [Guest User](guest-user.md) with minimal permissions. These accounts have no personal settings such as the [__Changes__](viewing-your-changes.md) page and Profile information as they are not related to any particular person but rather intended for special use cases.

## Credentials Authentication Modules

### Built-in Authentication

By default, TeamCity uses the built-in authentication and maintains users and their passwords by itself.

When signing in to TeamCity for the first time, the user will be prompted to create the TeamCity username and password which will be stored in TeamCity and used for authentication. If you installed TeamCity and signed in to it, it means that built-in authentication is enabled and all user data is stored in TeamCity.

In the beginning, the user database is empty. New users are either [added by the TeamCity administrator](managing-users-and-user-groups.md#Creating+New+User), or users register themselves if the corresponding option is enabled in the authentication module settings. All newly created users belong to the [All Users](user-group.md#%22All+Users%22+Group) group and have all roles assigned to this group. If some specific [roles](role-and-permission.md) are needed for the newly registered users, these roles should [be granted](managing-roles.md) via the __All Users__ group.

By default, the users are allowed to change their password on their profile page.

### Token-Based Authentication

This module allows users to authenticate via [access tokens](managing-your-user-account.md#Managing+Access+Tokens) that they can create and invalidate themselves.

This authentication module is enabled by default.

### Windows Domain Authentication

Allows user sign in using a Windows domain name and password. TeamCity checks these credentials: the server should be aware of the domain(s) users use to sign in. The supported syntax for the username is `DOMAIN\user.name` or `<username>@<domain>`.

In addition to signing in using the login form, you can enable [NTLM HTTP Authentication](ntlm-http-authentication.md) single sign-on.    
If you select the "Microsoft Windows Domain" preset, in addition to the login via a Windows domain, the [Basic HTTP](#Basic+HTTP+Authentication) and [NTLM](ntlm-http-authentication.md) authentication modules are enabled by default.

#### Specifying Default Domain

To allow users to enter the system using the login form without specifying the domain as a part of the username, do the following:
1. Go to __Administration | Authentication__.
2. Click __Edit__ next to the __Microsoft Windows domain__ authentication description.
3. Set the name in the _Default domain_ field.
4. Click __Done__ and __Save__ your changes.

#### Registering New Users on Login

The default settings allow users to register from the login page. TeamCity usernames for the new users will be the same as their Windows domain accounts.   
All newly created users belong to the [All Users](user-group.md#%22All+Users%22+Group) group and have all roles assigned to this group. If some specific [roles](role-and-permission.md) are needed for the newly registered users, these roles should [be granted](managing-roles.md) via the __All Users__ group.

To disable new user registration on login:
1. Go to __Administration | Authentication__.
2. Click __Edit__ next to the __Microsoft Windows domain__ authentication description. Clear the _Allow user registration from the login page_ box.
3. Click __Edit__ next to the __NTLM HTTP__ authentication description. Clean the _Allow user registration from the login page_ box.

#### Linux-Specific Configuration

If your TeamCity server runs under Linux, JCIFS library is used for the Windows domain login. This only supports Windows domain servers with SMB (SMBv1) enabled. SMB2 is not supported.  
The library is configured using the properties specified in the `<[TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md)>/config/ntlm-config.properties` file. Changes to the file take effect immediately without the server restart.

JCIFS library settings which cannot be changed in runtime or settings to affect HTTP NTLM settings can only be set via a properties' file passed via `-Djcifs.properties` JVM option.

If the default settings do not work for your environment, refer to [JCIFS](http://jcifs.samba.org/src/docs/api/) for all available configuration properties.   
If the library does not find the domain controller to authenticate against, consider adding the `jcifs.netbios.wins` property to the `ntlm-config.properties` file with the address of your WINS server. For other domain services locating properties, see [JCIFS](http://jcifs.samba.org/src/docs/resolver.html).

### LDAP Authentication

Please refer to the [dedicated page](ldap-integration.md).

## HTTP Authentication Modules

### Basic HTTP Authentication

Please refer to [Accessing Server by HTTP](accessing-server-by-http.md) for details about the basic HTTP authentication.

<tip>

For information on configuring basic HTTP authentication directly in the `<[TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md)>/config/auth-config.xml`, refer to the [earlier documentation version](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD8/Configuring+Authentication+Settings).
</tip>


### NTLM HTTP Authentication

Please refer to the [dedicated page](ntlm-http-authentication.md).

### Bitbucket Cloud

Since version 2020.2, users can sign in to TeamCity with a Bitbucket Cloud account.

Before enabling this module, you need to configure a [Bitbucket Cloud connection](integrating-teamcity-with-vcs-hosting-services.md#Connecting+to+Bitbucket+Cloud) in the Root project's settings and a dedicated application in Bitbucket.

To sign in, click the Bitbucket icon above the login form and, after the redirect, approve the TeamCity application. If a user with your Bitbucket email is registered and this email is verified both [in TeamCity](enabling-email-verification.md) and in Bitbucket, this Bitbucket account will be mapped with the respective TeamCity user and you will be signed in. Otherwise, TeamCity will create a new user profile, unless this option is disabled\*. It is also possible to [map existing TeamCity users](#User+Authentication+Settings) with Bitbucket Cloud profiles.
