The __Administration | Subscription & Resources__ page allows you to manage the TeamCity Cloud subscription, get extra build resources, and view the statistics of expenses. This page is only available to [Cloud Account Administrators]().

## Upgrade Subscription

Under the __My Subscription__ section, you can see how many credits and resources are left in your subscription. By clicking __Upgrade subscription__, you will be redirected to the JetBrains e-store where you can increase your subscription level if necessary.

## Get Extra Credits and Resources

Under the __Available Resources__ section, you can view more detailed information on resources and credits left, and exchange credits for more committer slots, concurrent builds on self-hosted agents, and artifact storage. Read more about on-demand resources in [TeamCity Cloud Subscription and Licensing](teamcity-cloud-subscription-and-licensing.md#On-demand+Cloud+Resources).

## Review Statistics of Expenses

This page also lets you track the details of your TeamCity cloud instance:
* The __Committers Report__ tab shows statistics of active committers, who actively contribute to the source code, and users with a free license, who have authored less than 10 commits during the last 30 days.
* The __Build Credits__ tab shows all operations with acquiring and spending credits, in a table or chart view.
* The __Storage__ tab shows trends of used artifact storage and data transfer capacity.

## Managing Cloud Account Administrators

System Administrators can assign a user to a _Cloud Account Administrator_ role in __Administration | Cloud Account Administrators__. Such a user will be granted access to the __Subscription & Resources__ page and will be able to exchange build credits for cloud resources. Roles can be unassigned anytime.
