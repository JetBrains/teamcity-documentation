The _Duplicates Finder (Java)_ build runner is intended for catching similar code fragments and providing a report on discovered repetitive blocks of Java code. This runner is based on IntelliJ IDEA capabilities, so an IntelliJ IDEA project file (`.ipr`) or directory (`.idea`) is required to configure the runner.

In addition to the bundled version, it is possible to install another version of JetBrains IntelliJ Inspections and Duplicates Engine and/or change the defaults using the __[Administration | Tools](installing-agent-tools.md)__ page.
{product="tc"}

The Duplicates Finder (Java) runner can also find Java duplicates in projects built by Maven2 or above.

<note>

In order to run inspections for your project you should have either an IntelliJ IDEA project file (`.ipr`)/project directory (`.idea`), or Maven2 or above `pom.xml` of your project checked into your version control.
</note>

This page contains reference information about the following Duplicates Finder (Java) build runner's fields.

## IntelliJ IDEA Project Settings

<td>

Project file type

</td>

<td>

To be able to run IntelliJ IDEA inspections on your code, TeamCity requires either an IntelliJ IDEA project file/directory, Maven `pom.xml` or Gradle `build.gradle` to be specified here.

</td></tr><tr>

<td>

Path to the project

</td>

<td>

Depending on the type of project selected in the __Project file type__, specify here:

 * __For IntelliJ IDEA project__: the path to the project file (`.ipr`) or the path to the project directory the root directory of the project containing the `.idea` directory).
 * __For Maven project__: the path to the `pom.xml` file. 
 * __For Gradle project__: the path to the `.gradle` file.

This information is required by this build runner to understand the structure of the project.

>The specified path should be relative to the checkout directory.

<td>

Detect global libraries and module-based JDK in the `*.iml` files

</td>

<td>

_This option is available if you use an IntelliJ IDEA project._ In IntelliJ IDEA, the module settings are stored in `*.iml` files, thus, if this option is checked, all the module files will be automatically scanned for references to the global libraries and module JDKs when saved. This helps ensure that all references will be properly resolved.

<warning>

When this option is selected, the process of opening and saving the build runner settings may become time-consuming, because it involves loading and parsing all project module files.
</warning>

</td></tr><tr>

<td>

Check/Reparse Project

</td>

<td>

_This option is available if you use an IntelliJ IDEA project._ Click this button to reparse your IntelliJ IDEA project and import the build settings right from the project, for example the list of JDKs.

<note>

If you update your project settings in IntelliJ IDEA (for example, add new JDKs, libraries), remember to update the build runner settings by clicking __Check/Reparse Project__.

<td>

Use these options to define which elements of the source code should be distinguished when searching for repetitive code fragments. Code fragments can be considered duplicated if they are structurally similar, but contain different variables, fields, methods, types or literals. Refer to the samples below:

</td></tr><tr>

<td id="duplicatorDistinguishVariablesOptionDescription">

If this option is checked, the similar contents with different variable names will be recognized as different. If this option is not checked, such contents will be recognized as duplicated:

```Java

public static void main(String[] args) {
            int i = 0;
            int j = 0;
            if (i == j) {
                System.out.println("sum of " + i + " and " + j + " = " + i + j);
            }
 
            long k = 0;
            long n = 0;
            if (k == n) {

If this option is checked, the similar contents with different field names will be recognized as different. If this option is not checked, such contents will be recognized as duplicated:

```Java

myTable.addSelectionListener(new SelectionListener() {
            public void widgetDefaultSelected(SelectionEvent e) {
            }
            /*.....**/

           /*.....**/
 
        });

```

</td></tr><tr>

<td id="duplicatorDistinguishMethodsOptionDescription">

Distinguish methods

</td>

<td>

If this option is checked, the methods of similar structure will be recognized as different. If this option is not checked, such methods will be recognized as duplicated. In this case, they can be extracted and reused. Initial version:

```Java

public void buildCanceled(Build build, SessionData data) {
        /*  ... **/
        for (IListener listener : getListeners()) {
            listener.buildCanceled(build, data);
        }
    }
 
    public void buildFinished(Build build, SessionData data) {
         /*  ... **/
        for (IListener listener : getListeners()) {
            listener.buildFinished(build, data);
        }
    }

```

After analyzing code for duplicates without distinguishing methods, the duplicated fragments can be extracted:

```Java

public void buildCanceled(final Build build, final SessionData data) {
    enumerateListeners(new Processor() {
      public void process(final IListener listener) {
        listener.buildCanceled(build, data);
      }
    });
  }
 
  public void buildFinished(final Build build, final SessionData data) {
    enumerateListeners(new Processor() {
      public void process(final IListener listener) {
        listener.buildFinished(build, data);
      }
    });
  }
 
  private void enumerateListeners(Processor processor) {/*  ... **/
 
  for (IListener listener : getListeners()) {
      processor.process(listener);
    }
  }
 
  private interface Processor {
    void process(IListener listener);
  }

```

<anchor name="IdeaPatterns"/>

Include / exclude patterns are newline-delimited set of rules of the form:

```Shell

[+:|-:]pattern

```

Where the pattern must satisfy these rules:
* must end with either `**` or `*` (this effectively limits the patterns to only the directories level, they do not support file-level patterns)
* references to modules can be included as `[module_name]/<path_within_module>`
Some notes on patterns processing:
* excludes have precedence over includes
* if include patterns are specified, only directories matching these patterns will be included, all other directories will be excluded
* "include" pattern has a special behavior (due to underlying limitations): it includes the directory specified and all the files residing directly in the directories above the one specified.

Example:

```Shell

+:testData/tables/**   
-:testData/**   
-:testdata/**   
-:[testData]/**

```

>For the file paths to be reported correctly, the "_References to resources outside project/module file directory_" option for the project and all modules should be set to "Relative" in IDEA project.
