<note>

Since TeamCity 2019.2.3, we have stopped providing active support for the MSBuild runner. Please use the .NET runner with the `msbuild` command instead. For more details on migration, refer to the [.NET runner description](net.md#Migrating+from+MSBuild+Runner).

</note>

This page contains reference information for the __MSBuild__ build runner fields.

<note>

The MSBuild runner requires .NET Framework or Mono installed on the build agent. [Microsoft Build Tools](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild-is-now-part-of-visual-studio/) 2013-2019 are supported.

Before setting up a build configuration to use MSBuild as the build runner, make sure you are using an XML build project file with the MSBuild runner.

To build a Microsoft Visual Studio solution file, you can use the [Visual Studio (sln)](visual-studio-sln.md) build runner.

## General Build Runner Options

<table><tr>

<td>

Option


</td>

<td>

Description


</td></tr><tr>

<td>

 Build file path


</td>

<td>

Specify the path to the solution to be built relative to the [build checkout directory](build-checkout-directory.md). For example, `vs-addin\addin\addin.sln`.

</td></tr><tr>

<td>

Working directory


</td>

<td>

Optional. Specify the path to the [build working directory](build-working-directory.md) if it differs from the build checkout directory.

</td></tr><tr>

<td>

MSBuild version


</td>

<td>

Select the MSBuild version: .NET Framework, Mono xbuild or Microsoft Build Tools.


</td></tr><tr>

<td>

MSBuild ToolsVersion


</td>

<td>

Specify here the version of tools that will be used to compile (equivalent to the `/toolsversion:` commandline argument).

<note>

MSBuild supports compilation to older versions, thus you may set __MSBuild version__ as 4.6.1 with __MSBuild ToolsVersion__ set to 2.0 to produce .NET 2.0 assemblies while running MSBuild from .NET Framework 4.6.1. For more information, refer to [this article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383796(VS.100).aspx)

## Code Coverage

To learn about configuring code coverage options, refer to the [Configuring .NET Code Coverage](configuring-.net-code-coverage.md) page.

## Implementation notes

MSBuild runner generates an MSBuild script that includes user's script. This script is used to add TeamCity\-provided MSBuild tasks. Your MSBuild script will be included with the &lt;Import&gt; task. If you specified a Visual Studio solution file, it will be called from the &lt;MSBuild&gt; task. To disable it, set `teamcity.msbuild.generateWrappingScript` to `false`.
