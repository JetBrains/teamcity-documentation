## Differences between TeamCity Cloud and On-premises

We plan to provide equal CI/CD experience to users of our Cloud and On-premises versions. However, the Cloud version is an automatically configured server and thus does not provide the same server settings as our On-premises solution.

Comparing to On-premises, TeamCity Cloud Beta offers the following new features:
* For better security, you can generate authentication tokens for build agents in advance.
* If you authenticate via GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, the respective [connection](integrating-teamcity-with-vcs-hosting-services.md#Configuring+Connections) will be preconfigured automatically.
* The __Administration | Invitations__ page allows automatically inviting users to the server. __By default, you can add new users only via invitations__. An invited user will be able to register a new user account or authenticate via GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

All the listed features will be introduced in our On-premises version in the nearest future.

TeamCity Cloud Beta has the following limitations comparing to On-premises:
* Limited server configuration.
* No automatic server diagnostics.
* Data is backed up and cleaned up automatically. The set of available configuration options may differ from the On-premises installations.
* Some settings are unavailable to TeamCity Cloud administrators: for example, cloud profiles' configuration or changing the location for storing external artifacts.
* No plugin management. The following bundled plugins are currently disabled:
    * LDAP support
    * Microsoft Windows Domain authentication
    * VCS Support: CVS and VCS Support: StarTeam
    * RSS feed support
    * Build Agent JVM updater
    * NuGet Support
    * Search

Some listed features might be implemented or receive their Cloud equivalents in terms of the Beta or first released versions of TeamCity Cloud.
