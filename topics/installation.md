If you are upgrading your existing TeamCity installation, refer to [Upgrade](upgrade.md).

## Check System Requirements

Before you install TeamCity, please read about the [Supported Platforms and Environments](supported-platforms-and-environments.md). Additionally, read the [hardware requirements for TeamCity](how-to.md#Estimate-Hardware-Requirements-for-TeamCity). Note that these requirements differ significantly depending on the server load and the number of builds run.

## Select TeamCity Installation Package

You can also install TeamCity using the following __experimental options__:
* AWS [CloudFormation template](running-teamcity-stack-in-aws.md).
* TeamCity template on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-en/marketplace/apps/jetbrains.teamcity?tab=Overview). Read more in our [blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2018/09/teamcity-on-azure-marketplace/).
* [Azure Resource Manager template](https://github.com/JetBrains/teamcity-azure-template).
* [Google Cloud Deployment Manager template](https://github.com/JetBrains/teamcity-google-template).

<note>
Note that we do not guarantee support of experimental versions. For production purposes, we recommend using stable TeamCity distributives and Docker images.

For evaluation, we offer a limited cloud version via [TeamCity TestDrive](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/#section=testdrive).

## Install Additional Build Agents

Although the TeamCity server in `.exe` and `.tar.gz` distributions is installed with a default build agent that runs on the same machine as the server, this setup may result in degraded TeamCity web UI performance, and if your builds are CPU\-intensive, it is recommended to install build agents on separate machines or ensure that there is enough CPU/memory/disk throughput on the server machine.

To set up additional build agents, follow the [instructions](setting-up-and-running-additional-build-agents.md).
