[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Creating and Editing Projects)

This section details creating projects via the TeamCity web UI. Other options include the [REST API](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/rest/create-and-delete-projects.html) and using TeamCity project configuration in [DSL based on the Kotlin language](kotlin-dsl.md).

## Creating Project

To create a project, use the __Administration__ link in the upper right corner and click __Create project__. The __Create project__ page is displayed.

There are several options to create a project from:
* [from a repository URL](#Creating+project+pointing+to+repository+URL)
* [from GitHub.com](#Creating+project+pointing+to+GitHub.com+repository)
* [from Bitbucket (Cloud, Server, Data Center)](#Creating+project+pointing+to+Bitbucket)
* [from GitLab](#Creating+project+pointing+to+GitLab.com)
* [from Azure DevOps](#Creating+project+pointing+to+Azure+DevOps+Services)
* [from JetBrains Space](#Creating+project+pointing+to+JetBrains+Space)
* [manually](#Creating+project+manually)
 
Note that only two options are available by default: _From a repository URL_ and _Manually_. 
If a [connection](integrating-teamcity-with-vcs-hosting-services.md) to some VCS hosting service is configured in the Root project (or a parent project of the project to be created), the corresponding option becomes available, so you can create a project using an existing VCS connection specification.

>After you create a project from a URL or VCS, you can edit the project description. To add a link to your project description, use the Markdown format: \[My Project \](https://www.example.com).

To create a subproject, go to the __Project Settings__ page of the parent project and use one of the available options, similarly to creating a project.

### Creating project pointing to repository URL

1\. On the __Create project__ page, click the "From a repository URL" tile.

2\. Specify the project settings:

<table><tr>

<td>

Setting


</td>

<td>

Description


</td></tr><tr>

<td>

Parent Project


</td>

<td>

Select the parent project from the drop-down menu.


</td></tr><tr>

<td>

Repository URL


</td>

<td>

A VCS repository [URL](guess-settings-from-repository-url.md). TeamCity recognizes URLs for Subversion, Git, and Mercurial. TFS and Perforce are partially supported.

Icons next to this field represent VCS hosting services supported by TeamCity. If you click an active (highlighted) icon, you will be able to select an existing connection specification. If you click an inactive icon, you will be redirected to the _Add Connection_ form.

</td></tr><tr>

<td>

Username


</td>

<td>

Provide a username if access to the repository requires authentication.


</td></tr><tr>

<td>

Password


</td>

<td>

Provide a password or token if access to the repository requires authentication.


</td></tr></table>

3\. Click __Proceed__. TeamCity will configure the rest of settings for you.
 * it will determine the type of the VCS repository, autoconfigure VCS repository settings, and suggest the project and build configuration names.   
   For a Git repository, TeamCity will autodetect the default branch, but you have an option to change it and to add other branches to monitor by entering their [specification](working-with-feature-branches.md#Configuring+Branches).
 * the project, build configuration and VCS root will be created automatically.
 * TeamCity will add a VCS build trigger.
 * TeamCity will attempt to autodetect build steps: Ant, NAnt, Gradle, Maven, MSBuild, Visual Studio solution files, PowerShell, Xcode project files, Rake, and IntelliJ IDEA projects.

4\. On the __Auto-detected Build Steps__ page select the detected step(s) to use in your build configuration. Click __Use selected__. If no steps found, you will have to [configure build steps manually](configuring-build-steps.md).

5\. Your project and a build configuration are configured. Click the __Run__ button to start the build.   
Depending on the build configuration settings, TeamCity can suggest some additional configuration options. Review Suggestions at the end of the settings list and configure required ones.

### Creating project pointing to JetBrains Space

>If you are looking for how to integrate your JetBrains Space instance with TeamCity, check out this **[full integration guide](how-to-configure-cicd-for-jetbrains-space.md)**!

Before creating a project from a JetBrains Space, you need to configure a [dedicated connection to your Space instance](configuring-connections.md#connect-to-jetbrains-space).

1. On the __Create project__ page, click a "From JetBrains Space" tile to create a project from an [existing connection](configuring-connections.md#connect-to-jetbrains-space). The first time, you will be prompted to sign in to Space and grant TeamCity access to view your user profile and projects. To be able to do this, TeamCity will create a service token for authenticating in your Space instance.
2. Select a repository. TeamCity will verify the repository connection. If the connection is verified, the new page opens.
3. TeamCity will display the project and build configuration names. If required, modify them and click __Proceed__. For a Git repository, TeamCity will autodetect the default branch, but you have an option to change it and to add other branches to monitor by entering their [specification](working-with-feature-branches.md#Configuring+Branches).
4. TeamCity will add a VCS build trigger and attempt to autodetect build steps.

</td>

<td>

Optional description for the project. You can add a link in the Markdown format to the description:

```Text
[My Project](https://www.example.com)
```

</td></tr></table>

3\. Click __Create__. An empty project is created.

<tip>

To configure an existing project, select the desired project in the list, and click the __Edit Project Settings__ link on the right.
</tip>

4\. [Create build configurations](creating-and-editing-build-configurations.md) (select build settings, [configure VCS settings](configuring-vcs-settings.md), and choose [build runners](build-runner.md)) for the project.

5\. [Assign build configurations to specific build agents](assigning-build-configurations-to-specific-build-agents.md).

## Managing Project

You can view all available projects and subprojects on the __Projects__ page listed in the alphabetical order by default. Administrators can [customize the default order](ordering-projects-and-build-configurations.md).

When you select a project from the list, TeamCity displays the __Project Home__ page where you can preview its nested build configurations and recent build results. To access the project's settings, click __Edit Project Settings__ in the upper right corner of the screen.

To copy, move, delete or [archive](archiving-projects.md) a project, use the __Actions__ menu in the upper right corner of the __Project Settings__ page or the _More_ button ![moreButton.PNG](moreButton.PNG) next to the project on the parent __Project Settings__ page. These options are not available for the Root project.

### Copying Project

Use the corresponding item from the __Actions__ menu in the upper right corner of the __Project Settings__ page or the _More_ button ![moreButton.PNG](moreButton.PNG) next to the project on the parent __Project Settings__ page.

Projects can be copied and moved to another project by project administrators.

A copy duplicates all the settings, [subprojects](project.md#Project+Hierarchy), [build configurations](managing-builds.md), and [templates](build-configuration-template.md) of the original project, but no data related to builds is preserved. The copy is created with the empty [build history](build-results-page.md#Build+History+in+Classic+UI) and no [statistics](statistic-charts.md).

You can copy a project into the same or another parent.

On copying, TeamCity automatically assigns a new name and [ID](identifier.md) to the copy. It is also possible to change the name and ID manually.   
Selecting the __Copy project-associated user, agent and other settings__ option makes sure that all the settings like notification rules or agent's compatibility are exactly the same for the copied and original projects for all the users and agents affected.

You can also opt to copy build configurations build numbers.

<note instance="tc">

When running TeamCity in the [Professional mode](licensing-policy.md), the __Copy__ option will not be displayed for a project if the number of build configurations on the server after copying will exceed the limit (100 build configurations, unless you purchased additional build agent licenses).
</note>


<anchor name="CreatingandEditingProjects-MovingProject"/>

### Moving Project

<warning>

Before moving the project, consider the following:
* TeamCity assigns user roles on a [per-project](managing-roles-and-permissions.md) basis, which means that moving a project may result in __changing the scope of user permissions__ in the new project (new permissions may be added or the existing permissions can be dropped)
* Connection to Git VCS Roots containing SSH keys may get unavailable after a project move.
</warning>


To move a project, use the corresponding item from the __Actions__ menu in the upper right corner of the __Project Settings__ page or the _More_ button ![moreButton.PNG](moreButton.PNG) next to the project on the parent __Project Settings__ page.

When moving a project, TeamCity preserves all its settings, [subprojects](project.md#Project+Hierarchy), [build configurations](managing-builds.md)/[templates](build-configuration-template.md), and associated data, as well as the [build history](build-results-page.md#Build+History+in+Classic+UI).

### Archiving Project

Use the corresponding item from the __Actions__ menu in the upper right corner of the __Project Settings__ page or the _More_ button ![moreButton.PNG](moreButton.PNG) next to the project on the parent __Project Settings__ page. Refer to the dedicated [page](archiving-projects.md).

### Bulk Editing IDs

<warning>

Care must be taken when performing this action. Modifying the ID will change all the URLs related to the project. It is highly recommended to update the ID in any of the URLs bookmarked or hard\-coded in the scripts. The corresponding configuration and artifacts directory names on the disk will change too and it can take time.
</warning>

1. Use the corresponding item from the __Actions__ menu in the upper right corner of the __Project Settings__ page or the _More_ button ![moreButton.PNG](moreButton.PNG) next to the project on the parent __Project Settings__ page.
2. The current project and build configuration [IDs](identifier.md) are displayed. You can modify or reset the IDs for all subproject, VCS roots, build configurations and templates. Click __Regenerate__ to get new Ids automatically or edit them manually.
3. Click __Submit__.

### Pausing / Activating Triggers

You can [pause triggers](changing-build-configuration-status.md#Pausing+Several+Build+Configurations+in+Project) for all or selected build configurations of a project. Use the corresponding item from the __Actions__ menu in the upper right corner of the __Project Settings__ page or the _More_ button ![moreButton.PNG](moreButton.PNG) next to the project on the parent __Project Settings__ page.

### Exporting Project 

You can [export configuration files](project-export.md) of a project with its children to move it to a different TeamCity server. Use the corresponding item from the __Actions__ menu in the upper right corner of the __Project Settings__ page or the _More_ button ![moreButton.PNG](moreButton.PNG) next to the project on the parent __Project Settings__ page.

### Deleting Project

Use the corresponding item from the __Actions__ menu in the upper right corner of the __Project Settings__ page or the _More_ button ![moreButton.PNG](moreButton.PNG) next to the project on the parent __Project Settings__ page.

When you delete a project, TeamCity will remove its `.xml` configuration files. After the deletion, the project is moved to the \<[TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md)\>/config/_trash/.ProjectID.projectN directory. There is a [configurable](teamcity-data-clean-up.md#Deleted+Build+Configurations+Clean-up) timeout (5 days by default) before all project-related data stored in the database (build history, artifacts, and so on) of the deleted project is completely removed during the next build history clean-up.

>You can [restore](how-to.md#Restore+Just+Deleted+Project) a deleted project before the clean-up is run.
>
{instance="tc"}

The \<[TeamCity Data Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md)\>/config/_trash/ directory is not cleaned automatically and can be emptied manually if you are sure you do not need the deleted projects. 

<tip>

If you attempt to delete a project with [dependent build configurations](dependent-build.md) from other projects, TeamCity will warn you about it. If you proceed with the deletion, the dependencies will no longer function.
