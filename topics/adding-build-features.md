A _build feature_ is a piece of functionality that can be added to a build configuration to affect running builds or reporting build results.

## TeamCity Build Features

TeamCity ships with the following build features that can be added to your configurations:

<dl>

<dt>AssemblyInfo Patcher</dt>
<dd>Allows you to set a build number to an assembly automatically, without having to patch the AssemblyInfo.cs files manually.&emsp;<a href="assemblyinfo-patcher.md">Learn more...</a></dd>

<dt>Automatic Merge</dt>
<dd>Tracks builds in required branches and merges them into a target branch if a build satisfies the configured condition (for example, the build is successful).&emsp;<a href="automatic-merge.md">Learn more...</a></dd>

<dt>AWS Credentials</dt>
<dd>Shares an AWS connection configured in a TeamCity project to build steps.&emsp;<a href="aws-credentials.md">Learn more...</a></dd>

<dt>Build Approval</dt>
<dd>Allows you to specify TeamCity users whose approval is required to start a new build.&emsp;<a href="build-approval.md">Learn more...</a></dd>

<dt>Build Files Cleaner (Swabra)</dt>
<dd>Cleans files produced during a build.&emsp;<a href="build-files-cleaner-swabra.md">Learn more...</a></dd>

<dt>Build Cache</dt>
<dd>Allows builds to obtain files acquired by previously finished builds (for example, downloaded <code>npm</code> packages.&emsp;<a href="build-cache.md">Learn more...</a></dd>

<dd>Allows build configurations to automatically sign in a DockerHub or other container registry before the build start.&emsp;<a href="docker-support.md">Learn more...</a></dd>

<dt>File Content Replacer</dt>

<dt>Free Disc Space</dt>
<dd>Checks whether a build agent has enough free disc space before it runs a build, and cleans up old build data in case it does not. &emsp;<a href="free-disk-space.md">Learn more...</a></dd>

<dt>Golang</dt>
<dd>Enables the real-time reporting and history of Go test results in TeamCity.&emsp;<a href="golang.md">Learn more...</a></dd>

<dt>Investigations Auto Assigner</dt>

<dt>Jira Cloud Integration</dt>
<dd>Allows reporting build statuses directly to Jira Cloud in real time.&emsp;<a href="jira-cloud-integration.md">Learn more...</a></dd>

<dt>Matrix Build</dt>
<dd>Allows you to set up a matrix where multiple parameters have several potential values each. Running such build configurations spawns N separate builds that test each individual parameter/value combination.&emsp;<a href="matrix-build.md">Learn more...</a></dd>

<dt>Notifications</dt>
<dd>Notifies required users about build statuses and events via e-mails or Slack messages.&emsp;<a href="notifications.md">Learn more...</a></dd>

## How to Add, Remove, and Disable Build Features

### In TeamCity UI

1. Navigate to **Administration | &lt;YOUR_PROJECT&gt; | &lt;YOUR_BUILD_CONFIGURATION&gt;** and switch to the **Build Features** tab.

    <img src="dk-add-new-build-feature.png" width="706" alt="Add New Build Feature"/>

2. Click **Add build feature** and choose a required feature from the list.

3. Specify required feature settings and click **Save**.

The **Build Features** page also allows you to temporarily disable or permanently remove a configured build feature.

<img src="dk-disable-or-delete-feature.png" width="706" alt="Disable or delete a build feature"/>

### In Kotlin DSL

Add a corresponding feature to the **Approval** block of your [Kotlin DSL](kotlin-dsl.md). For example, the following sample adds the [](build-approval.md) feature that requires one user to approve new configuration builds.


```Kotlin
object MyBuildConfig : BuildType({
    // ...
   features {
       approval {
           approvalRules = "user:Valravn"
       }
   }
})
```

### Using REST API

Send GET, POST, and DELETE requests to the `/app/rest/buildTypes/<build_type_locator>/features` endpoint to obtain and remove existing build features and add new ones.

For example, a POST request using the following body adds the [](pull-requests.md) feature to the configuration.

<tabs>

<tab title="JSON">

```JSON
{
    "type": "pullRequests",
    "properties": {
        "property": [
            { 
                "name": "providerType",
                "value": "github"
            },
                        { 
                "name": "ignoreDrafts",
                "value": "true"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

</tab>

<tab title="XML">

```XML
<feature type="pullRequests">
    <properties count="2">
        <property name="ignoreDrafts" value="true"/>
        <property name="providerType" value="github"/>
    </properties>
</feature>
```

</tab>

</tabs>

To disable an existing feature, send a PUT request with the `true` text body to the `/app/rest/buildTypes/<build-type-locator>/features/<ID>/disabled`.
