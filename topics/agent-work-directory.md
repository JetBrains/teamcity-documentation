_Agent work directory_ is the directory on a build agent that is used as a containing directory for the default [checkout directories](build-checkout-directory.md). By default, this is the [`<Build Agent Home>`](agent-home-directory.md)`/work` directory.

To modify the default directory location, see `workDir` parameter in [Build Agent Configuration](configure-agent-installation.md).

<note>

Note that TeamCity assumes full control over the directory and can [delete subdirectories](build-checkout-directory.md#Automatic+Checkout+Directory+Cleaning) if they do not correspond to checkout directories of the recent builds.
</note>

For more information on handling the directories inside the agent work directory, refer to the [Build Checkout Directory](build-checkout-directory.md) page.
