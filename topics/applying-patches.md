## Microsoft Visual Source Safe Integration

__To apply a patch for `vss-native.exe`__:
1. Shut down the TeamCity server.
2. Open the  `<`[`TeamCity Home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>/webapps/root/WEB-INF/plugins/vss/` or `<`[`TeamCity Home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>/webapps/root/WEB-INF/lib/` folder.
3. Back up the `vss-support.jar` file.
4. Inside the `vss-support.jar` file, replace the `/bin/vss-native.exe` with the new one.
5. Start the server.


__To apply a full VSS plugin patch__:
1. Shut down the TeamCity server.
2. Open  `<`[`TeamCity Home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>/webapps/root/WEB-INF/plugins/vss/` or `<`[`TeamCity Home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>/webapps/root/WEB-INF/lib/`.
3. Back up `vss-support.jar.`
4. Replace `vss-support.jar` with the new one.
5. Start the server.

### Capturing Logs From VSS-native

Each time TeamCity starts, it creates a new instance of the `vss-native.exe` file and places it into the `<`[`TeamCity Home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>/temp` folder. The name of the copy is generated automatically and uses the following template: `TC-VSS-NATIVE-<some digits>.exe`

To manually enable detailed logging (for debugging purposes) for VSS Native:
1. Copy the `<`[`TeamCity Home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>/temp/TC-VSS-NATIVE-<some digits>.exe` file to any folder.
2. Run the program with the `/log` switch.

To get the command line syntax and options reference, run the program without any switch.

## Microsoft Team Foundation Server Integration

### Capturing logs from TFS-native

__To enable creating logs from TFS\-native:__

2. Create a copy of the file in any other folder.
3. Run this program with the `/log` switch.

To get the command-line switches help, run the process with no parameters. Log files will be created in the `<TeamCity agent>/temp/buildTmp/TeamCity.NET` folder. For each process a new log file will be created.
