In __Administration | Invitations__, you can create an invitation link and send it to anyone you want to invite to your TeamCity Cloud server. On receiving an email, this user will be able to choose their username and password for authentication. You will see the status of all invitations on this page.

Alternatively, you can manually create a user profile on the __[Users](creating-and-managing-users.md)__ page.
