The Node.js build runner allows running Node.js tools like [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/), [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/), and [`node`](https://github.com/nodejs/node).

Refer to [Configuring Build Steps](configuring-build-steps.md) for a description of common build steps' settings.

## Prerequisites

Currently, Node.js steps can only be run inside a Docker/Podman container. Refer to [](container-wrapper.md) for general information about available Docker/Podman settings.

You can define which version of Node.js to use for the current build step. TeamCity uses a `node:lts` image by default, or, if there is a `.nvmrc` file inside your project, TeamCity automatically detects the image specification from there while creating a build step.

## Autodetecting JavaScript Steps

If your repository contains a `package.json` file, TeamCity will [automatically detect](configuring-build-steps.md#Add+Steps+via+TeamCity+UI) used frameworks and propose adding respective build steps.

>If TeamCity detects a dependency on a test framework, it will propose choosing between two steps: run tests via this framework or with a general `test` command. To display structured test reports in TeamCity, select the step with the framework.

Currently supported frameworks are [ESlint](https://eslint.org/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

If TeamCity detects an `.nvmrc` file, it will automatically use the node version specified in it.

## Running Node.js Commands

In the _Shell script_ field, enter all Node.js commands to be executed in this step.

## Accessing Private NPM Registries

To access a private npm registry during a build (for example, to download a package), you need to:
1. Configure an _NPM Registry_ connection as described [here](configuring-connections.md#npm-registry-settings).
2. <include from="common-templates.md" element-id="open-configuration-settings-tab"><var name="configuration-tab-name" value="Build Features"/></include>
3. Add an _NPM Registry Connection_ build feature and select the connection created in step 1.

As a result, a TeamCity agent will authenticate in this registry during the build.

>Note that TeamCity will only be able to access registries where automation tokens are allowed. If your connection test fails in TeamCity, revise the registry settings.
> 
{style="note"}

Alternatively to this procedure, you can let TeamCity parse a token from the `.npmrc` file inside your JS project. To achieve this, declare a token variable in this file as specified [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/using-private-packages-in-a-ci-cd-workflow#create-and-check-in-a-project-specific-npmrc-file) and then create an [environment variable](configuring-build-parameters.md) `NPM_TOKEN` in TeamCity with the value of the access token and the "Password" type.

>If a token is configured in your NPM registry connection, TeamCity will use it for connecting to this registry. However, there is known issue when TeamCity might use the token specified in the `.npmrc` file instead of that in the connection settings. See the workarounds to this issue in [our tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-71200#focus=Comments-27-4854154.0-0).
