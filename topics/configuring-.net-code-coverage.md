TeamCity supports .NET code coverage using NCover, PartCover, and dotCover coverage engines. Configuration via the TeamCity UI is supported for:
* [NUnit build runner](nunit.md)
* NAnt runner: [&lt;nunit2&gt; NAnt task](nunit-for-nant-build-runner.md)
* MSBuild runner: &lt;NUnit&gt; and &lt;NUnitTeamCity&gt;[NUnit for MSBuild](nunit-for-msbuild.md)

For the [.NET CLI (dotnet)](net.md) runner and with NUnit version 3.x the only supported coverage tool is [JetBrains dotCover](jetbrains-dotcover.md).

If you use a test framework other than NUnit, you can configure coverage analysis manually using the [JetBrains dotCover](http://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/) console runner and TeamCity service messages as described in [Manually Configuring Reporting Coverage](manually-configuring-reporting-coverage.md).

Details on configuring code coverage can be found on the following pages:
