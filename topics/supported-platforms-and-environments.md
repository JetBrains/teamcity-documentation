This page covers software-related environments TeamCity works with. For hardware-related notes, see [this section](how-to.md#Estimate+Hardware+Requirements+for+TeamCity).

## Platforms (Operating Systems)

### TeamCity Server

Core features of TeamCity server are platform-independent. See [considerations](how-to.md#Choose+OS%2FPlatform+for+TeamCity+Server) on choosing server platform.   

The TeamCity server is a web application that runs within a capable J2EE servlet container.

The server requires a Java SE JRE installation to run. See [notes](installing-and-configuring-the-teamcity-server.md#Java+Installation) on how to install Java on the server.

<note>

__Since TeamCity 2019.2__, 64-bit [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/) 8 is included in the Windows `.exe` TeamCity distribution (previously, 32-bit Oracle Java and then AdoptOpenJDK were bundled with the TeamCity Windows distribution). Users of the bundled version of JRE are automatically switched to 64-bit Amazon Corretto on upgrading TeamCity to 2019.2.

</note>

Supported Java versions are OpenJDK and Oracle Java 8 (32 or 64 bit), version 8u16 (or 1.8.0_16) or later. We recommend using the latest available version of JDK 8. Experimental Java 11 support is also provided, but we highly recommend using Java 8 instead.   
Using 64-bit Java is recommended .

Note that the `.war` distribution is going to be discontinued, and it is highly recommended using the `.tar.gz` distribution which has Tomcat web server bundled. It is not advised to customize Tomcat settings unless absolutely necessary.   
If you still want to use the `.war` distribution, note that:

* TeamCity is tested only under Apache Tomcat 8.5+, earlier Tomcat versions are not supported.
* TeamCity is meant to support J2EE Servlet 3.0+ and JSP 2.2+ container based on Apache Jasper.
* TeamCity may not work properly if the [Apache Portable Runtime](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/apr.html) is enabled in Tomcat due to the issues in APR.

Generally, __all the recent versions of Windows, Linux and macOS are supported__. If you find any compatibility issues with any of the operating systems, make sure to [let us know](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TW/Feedback).

The TeamCity server is tested under the following operating systems:
* Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, RedHat, SUSE, and others)
* macOS
* Windows 7/7x64
* Windows Server 2008, 2012, 2016, 2019
* Server Core installation of Windows Server 2016
* Windows 10 under the Tomcat 8.5\+ web application server.
   
Reportedly works without known issues on:
* Windows 7+
* Windows Server 2008 R2
* Solaris
* FreeBSD
* IBM z/OS
* HP-UX
   
Note that Windows XP/XP x64 are not supported.

### Build Agents

The TeamCity Agent is a standalone Java application.

Build agents require a Java SE JRE installation to run. See [notes](setting-up-and-running-additional-build-agents.md#Configuring+Java) on how to configure Java on agents.

<note>

__Since TeamCity 2019.2__, 64-bit [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/) 8 is included in the Windows `.exe` TeamCity distribution (previously, 32-bit Oracle Java and then AdoptOpenJDK were bundled with the TeamCity Windows distribution). Users of the bundled version of JRE are automatically switched to 64-bit Amazon Corretto on upgrading TeamCity to 2019.2.

</note>

Supported Java versions are OpenJDK and Oracle Java 8 - 11. We recommend using the latest available version of JDK 8 (or 1.8). Support for running agents under Java 1.6 and 1.7 is deprecated.

The TeamCity agent is tested under the following operating systems:
* Linux
* macOS
* Windows 7/7x64
* Windows 10
* Windows Server 2003/2008, 2012, 2016, 2019
* Server Core installation of Windows Server 2016

Reportedly works on:
* Windows XP/XP x64
* Windows 2000 (interactive mode only)
* Solaris
* FreeBSD
* IBM z/OS
* HP-UX
   
### Windows Tray Notifier

Windows 7/7x64/10 with one of the supported versions of Internet Explorer.

## Web Browsers

The TeamCity Web Interface is mostly W3C\-compliant, so just about any modern browser should work well with TeamCity. The following browsers have been specifically tested and reported to work correctly in the recent versions of:
   * Google Chrome
   * Mozilla Firefox 
   * Safari under Mac
   * Microsoft Edge
   * Microsoft Internet Explorer 11\+. Support for Internet Explorer 10 is discontinued since TeamCity 2018.1.4.
   * Opera 15+
