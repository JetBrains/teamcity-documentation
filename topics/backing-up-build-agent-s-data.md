To back up build agent's data:
	
1. __Build Agent configuration__   
Back up the `<[Agent Home Directory](agent-home-directory.md)>/conf/buildAgent.properties` file.   
You may also wish to back up any other configuration files changed (the build agent's configuration is specified in `<[Agent Home Directory](agent-home-directory.md)>/conf` and `<[Agent Home Directory](agent-home-directory.md)>/launcher/conf` directories).
	
2. __Log files__   
If you need build agent log files (mainly used for problem-solving or debug purposes), back up the `<[Agent Home Directory](agent-home-directory.md)>/logs` directory.

<note>

You may also wish to back up the build agent's Windows Service settings, if they were modified.
