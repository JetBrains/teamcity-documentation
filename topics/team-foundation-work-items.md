<note>

In 2019, Team Foundation Server has been renamed to Azure DevOps Server. The content of this page is applicable to Azure DevOps Server.

</note>

Team Foundation Work Items tracking is integrated with TeamCity. Supported versions are Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2012 or later, and Azure DevOps Services.

TFS work items support can be configured on the [Issue Trackers](integrating-teamcity-with-issue-tracker.md) page for a project. If a project has a [TFVC](team-foundation-server.md) root configured, TeamCity will suggest configuring the issue tracker as well.

## Integration

By default, the integration works the same way as the other issue tracker integrations: you need to mention the work item ID in the comment message, so the work items can be linked to builds and the links will be displayed in various places in the TeamCity web UI. 

Additionally, if your changeset has related work items, TeamCity can retrieve information about them and display information on the __Issue Log__ tab even if no comment is added to the changeset. Besides, custom states for resolved work items are supported by TeamCity.

## Custom Resolved States
{product="tc"}

In addition, resolved states in TeamCity can be customized by using the `teamcity.tfs.workItems.resolvedStates` [internal property](configuring-teamcity-server-startup-properties.md#TeamCity+internal+properties) set to `Closed?|Done|Fixed|Resolved?|Removed?` by default.
