The _Docker_ [build runner](build-runner.md) allows launching the `build`, `push`, and `tag` [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) commands inside your build.

>For the `run` command, use [](container-wrapper.md).

If you need to push the newly built image to a registry, you can authorize to a Docker or Podman registry by configuring the _Docker Support_ build feature, as follows:
1. In your project settings, select **Connections** from the sidebar and follow the instructions in [](configuring-connections-to-docker.md) to add new Docker or Podman connections to your project.
2. In your build configuration settings, follow the instructions in [](docker-support.md) to configure the **Docker Support** build feature, adding the connections created in the previous step.

If a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) is present in your VCS repository and you create a TeamCity project based on this repository, TeamCity will [autodetect it](configuring-build-steps.md#Autodetecting+Build+Steps) and offer creating a build step using this runner.

## Common Settings

This runner is a part of the TeamCity-Docker/Podman integration toolset. Refer to this documentation article for information on software requirements, supported environments, and other common aspects of this integration: [](integrating-teamcity-with-container-managers.md).

Available step execution policies are described [here](configuring-build-steps.md#Execution+Policy).

## Docker Command

The runner provides the following settings, depending on the selected command:

Depending on the selected source, the settings below will vary. Available options are _File_, _URL_, and _File content_.

</td></tr><tr>

<td>

Path to file

</td>

</td>

<td>

Available for the _URL_ source type:

The URL can refer to one of the three kinds of resources: Git repositories, prepackaged tarball contexts, and plain text files. See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#extended-description) for details.

<td>

Docker sub-command, like `push` or `tag`. For the `run` command, use [](container-wrapper.md).

</td></tr><tr>

Working directory

</td>

<td>

Specify the [build working directory](build-working-directory.md) if it differs from the [checkout directory](build-checkout-directory.md).

</td></tr><tr>

Additional arguments for the command

</td>

Additional arguments that will be passed to the `docker` command.

## Running Docker via sudo

You can enforce starting Docker commands on a TeamCity agent via `sudo`. Add the `teamcity.docker.use.sudo=true` setting in the [build agent configuration file](configure-agent-installation.md) or as an agent's system property. On the agent start, the TeamCity agent log will inform you that the `sudo` prefix is used to run Docker commands.

To configure the `sudoers` file for the `sudo` command, use [`visudo`](https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.17/visudo.man.html) as follows:

```Shell
buildagentuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:SETENV:<full_path_to_docker>

```

We recommend removing (or commenting out) the `Defaults requiretty` line from the `sudoers` file to prevent the [problem with `docker login`](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-60990).


## Building Multi-Arch Images

The **other...** command allows you to execute any custom `docker ...` commands. For example, you can invoke [buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx) commands to build multi-arch images.

1. Add a new **Docker** runner to your build configuration.
2. Switch its **Docker command** option to "other...".
3. Type "buildx" in the **Command name** field and "create --use" in **Additional arguments for the command**. TeamCity will combine these fields into a single `docker buildx create --use` command.
4. Repeat steps 1~3 to for each new command you want to execute. For example, you may want to add additional nodes (`docker buildx create --append --name mybuild <context_name>`) or call `docker buildx build <path> --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64` to start building and image.
