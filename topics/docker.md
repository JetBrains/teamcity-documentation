TeamCity comes with built-in [Docker integration](integrating-teamcity-with-docker.md), which includes the Docker runner (formerly Docker Build), a runner for Docker commands.

<include src="integrating-teamcity-with-docker.md" include-id="reqs-supported-env"/>

<chunk include-id="docker-runner">

The Docker runner supports the `build`, `push`, and `tag` Docker commands.

When creating TeamCity projects / build configurations from a repository URL, the runner is offered as build step during auto-detection, provided a Dockerfile is present in the VCS repository.

#### Running Docker via sudo

__Since TeamCity 2019.1.2__, you can enforce starting Docker commands on a TeamCity agent via `sudo`. Add the `teamcity.docker.use.sudo=true` setting in the [build agent configuration file](build-agent-configuration.md) or as an agent's system property. On an agent start, the TeamCity agent log will inform that the `sudo` prefix is used to run Docker commands.

To configure the `sudoers` file for the `sudo` command, use [`visudo`](https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.17/visudo.man.html) as follows:

```Shell
buildagentuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:SETENV:<full_path_to_docker>

```

We recommend removing (or commenting out) the `Defaults requiretty` line from the `sudoers` file to prevent the [problem with `docker login`](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-60990).
