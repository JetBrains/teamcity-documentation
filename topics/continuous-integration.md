Continuous integration is a software engineering term describing a process that completely rebuilds and tests an application frequently. Generally it takes the form of a server process or daemon that:
	
* Monitors a file system or version control system (for example, CVS) for changes.
* Runs the build process (for example, a make script or Ant\-style build script).
* Runs test scripts (for example, JUnit or NUnit).

Continuous integration is also associated with _Extreme Programming_ and other _agile_ software development practices.

Following the principles of _Continuous Integration_, TeamCity allows users to monitor the software development process of the company, while improving communication and facilitating the integration of changes without breaking any established practices.
