[//]: # (title: Build Failure Conditions)
[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Build Failure Conditions)

TeamCity allows changing the conditions under which a build is marked as _failed_. You can adjust these _build failure conditions_ in __[Build Configuration Settings](creating-and-editing-build-configurations.md) | Failure Conditions__

>To fail a build if sufficient disk space cannot be freed for the build, see the [Free disk space](free-disk-space.md) build feature.

## Common build failure conditions

In the __Common Failure Conditions__ block, you can specify how exactly TeamCity will fail builds:
* _if it runs longer than ... minutes_: Enter a value in minutes to enable execution timeout for a build. If the specified amount of time is exceeded, the build is automatically canceled.
   * Unless set to 0, this build configuration setting overrides the [server-wide](teamcity-configuration-and-maintenance.md) default execution timeout specified in __Administration | Global Settings__.
   * The default value of 0 means that no limit is set by the build configuration. If there is a [server-wide](teamcity-configuration-and-maintenance.md) default execution timeout, this default will be used.   
This option helps to deal with hanging builds and maintains agent efficiency.
* _if the build process exit code is not zero_: Mark the build as failed if the build process doesn't exit successfully.
* _if at least one test failed_: Mark the build as failed if the build fails at least one test. If this option is disabled, the build can be marked successful even if it fails to pass a number of tests. Regardless of this option, TeamCity will run all build steps.
  <anchor name="test-retry"/>
  * _support test retry: successful test run mutes previous test failure_ – if enabled, TeamCity will mute a test if it fails and then succeeds within the same build. Such tests will not affect the build status. This is convenient for configurations with flaky tests that alternately fail and succeed when applied to the same source revision. 
* _if an error message is logged by build runner_: Mark the build as failed if the build runner reports an error while building.
* _if an out-of-memory problem or crash is detected (Java only)_: Mark the build as failed if a crash of the JVM is detected, or Java has out of memory problems. If possible, TeamCity will upload crash logs and memory dumps as artifacts for such builds.

## Additional Failure Conditions

You can instruct TeamCity to mark a build as failed if some of its metrics (for example, code coverage or artifacts size) have changed compared to another build. For instance, you can mark a build as failed if the code duplicates number is higher than in the previous build.

Another build failure condition causes TeamCity to mark build as failed when a certain text is present in the build log.

To add such failure condition, click __Add build failure condition__ and select from the list:
* [Fail build on metric change](#Fail+build+on+metric+change)
* [Fail build on specific text in build log](#Fail+build+on+specific+text+in+build+log)

>You can disable a build failure condition temporarily or permanently at any time, even if it is inherited from a build configuration template.

### Fail build on metric change

When your build uses code examining tools like code coverage, duplicates finders, or inspections, it generates various numeric metrics. For these metrics, you can specify a threshold which, when exceeded, will fail a build.

In general, there are two ways to configure this build fail condition:
* A _build metric_ exceeds or is less than the specified constant value (threshold).   
For example, _Fail build if_ its "_build duration (secs)_", compared to the constant value, is "_more_" than "_300_".   
In this case, a build will fail if it runs more than 300 seconds. 
* A _build metric_ has changed comparing to a specific build by a specified value.   
For example, _Fail build if_ its "_build duration (secs)_" compared to a value from another build is "_more_" by at least "_300_" default units for this metric than the value in the "_Last successful build_".   
In this case, a build will fail if it runs 300 seconds longer than the last successful build. If a [branch specification](working-with-feature-branches.md) is configured, the [following logic](working-with-feature-branches.md#Failure+Conditions) is applied.

Values from the following builds can be used as the basis for comparing build metrics:
* last successful build
* last pinned build
* last finished build
* build with specified build number
* last finished build with specified tag.

By default, TeamCity provides the wide range of _build metrics_:
* artifacts size(bytes) – size of artifacts, excluding [internal artifacts](build-artifact.md#Hidden+Artifacts) under the `.teamcity` directory
* build duration (secs)
* number of classes
* number of code duplicated
* number of covered classes
* number of covered lines
* number of covered methods
* number of failed tests
* number of ignored tests
* number of inspection errors
* number of inspection warnings
* number of lines of code
* number of methods
* number of passed tests
* number of tests
* percentage of block coverage
* percentage of class coverage
* percentage of line coverage
* percentage of method coverage
* percentage of statement coverage
* test duration (secs)
* total artifacts size (bytes) – size of all artifacts including [internal ones](build-artifact.md#Hidden+Artifacts)

Note that since TeamCity 9.0, the way TeamCity counts tests [has changed](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TW/Hajipur+9.0+EAP1+(build+31423)+Release+Notes).

### Adding custom build metric

You can add your own build metric. To do so, you need to modify the TeamCity configuration file `<[TeamCity_Data_Directory](teamcity-data-directory.md)>/config/main-config.xml` and add the following section under the `server` node there:


```XML
<build-metrics>
  <statisticValue key="myMetric" description="build metric for number of files"/>
</build-metrics>

```

If your build publishes the `myMetric` value, you can use it as a criterion for a build failure.

<anchor name="BuildFailureConditions-Failbuildonspecifictextinbuildlog"/>

### Fail build on specific text in build log

TeamCity can inspect all lines in a build log for some particular text occurrence that indicates a build failure. When matching lines, the time and block name prefixes preceding each log message are ignored.

To configure this build failure condition, specify:
* a string or a [Java Regular Expression](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) whose presence/absence in the build log is an indicator of a build failure,
* a failure message to be displayed on the build results page when a build fails due to this condition.

### Stopping build immediately

You can stop a build immediately on encountering a specified text in the build log or when a certain build metric, specified using the _Fail build on metric change_ condition, is exceeded.
