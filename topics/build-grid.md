A build grid is a pool of computers ([build agents](build-agent.md)) used by TeamCity to simultaneously create builds of multiple projects. The build grid employs currently unused resources from multiple computers, any of which can run multiple builds and/or tests at the same time, for single or multiple projects across your company.
