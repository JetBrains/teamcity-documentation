[//]: # (auxiliary-id: TeamCity Server Logs)

TeamCity Server keeps a log of internal activities that can be examined to investigate an issue with the server behavior or get internal error details.

The logs are stored in plain text files in a disk directory on the TeamCity server machine (usually in `<`[`TeamCity Server home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>/logs`). The files are appended with messages when TeamCity is running.

While the server is running, the logs can be viewed in the web UI on the `Server Logs` tab of __Administration | Diagnostics__ section.

<tip>

__Enable Debug in Server Logs__

In the web UI, go to __Administration | Diagnostics__ page. On the __Troubleshooting__ tab, choose a logging preset, view logs under __Server Logs__ subsection.   

If it is not possible to enable debug logging mode from the TeamCity web UI, refer to [Changing Logging Configuration](#Changing+Logging+Configuration) section to learn how to adjust logging options manually.

## General Logging Description

TeamCity uses [log4j library](http://logging.apache.org/log4j) for the logging and its settings can be [customized](#Changing+Logging+Configuration).

By default, log files are located under the `<`[`TeamCity Server home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>/logs` directory.

The most important log files are:

Other files can also be created on [changing Logging Configuration](#Changing+Logging+Configuration).

Some of the files can have `.N` extensions \- that are files with previous logging messages copied on main file rotation. See [`maxBackupIndex`](#Changing+Logging+Settings) for preserving more files.

## Logging-related Diagnostics UI

Users with System Administrator role can view and download the server logs right from the TeamCity UI using __Administration | Diagnostics | Server Logs__.

## Changing Logging Configuration

While TeamCity is running, active logging settings can be changed by selecting between available `logging presets`.

The active logging preset is changed in the __Administration | Diagnostics__ page, __Troubleshooting__, __Debug logging__ subsection. Choosing a preset changes logging configuration immediately and the preset is preserved after a server restart, until changed on the page again. It is recommended to return to the "&lt;Default&gt;" once the necessary logs were collected.

The available presets are stored in the files with .xml extension under `<`[`TeamCity Data Directory`](teamcity-data-directory.md)`>/config/_logging` directory. New files can be added into the directory and existing files can be modified (using [.dist convention](teamcity-data-directory.md#.dist+Template+Configuration+Files)). New presets can also be uploaded via __Diagnostics | Logging Presets__.

If it is not possible to enable debug logging mode via logging presets (for example, to get the logging during server initialization) or to make persistent changes to the logging, you can backup the `conf/teamcity-server-log4j.xml` file and copy/rename the `<`[`TeamCity Data Directory`](teamcity-data-directory.md)`>/config/_logging/debug-general.xml` file over `conf/teamcity-server-log4j.xml` before the server start.

### Changing Logging Settings

If you want to fine\-tune the log4j configuration, you can edit `<`[`TeamCity Server home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>/conf/teamcity-server-log4j.xml` file (for `.war` TeamCity distribution, see the [related section](#General+Logging+Configuration)). If the server is running, the log4j configuration file will be reloaded automatically and the logging configuration will be changed on the fly (some log4j restrictions still apply, so for a massive change consider restarting the server).

If you change settings in other preset files, like `debug-all.xml` or `debug-vcs.xml`, the settings won't be picked up automatically. To enforce the change, switch logging preset to some other value, like `<Default>` and then switch back to `debug-all`. 

Most useful settings of log4j configuration:   
To change the minimum log level to save in the file, tweak the `value` attribute of the `priority` element:


```Plain Text
<category ...>
    <priority value="INFO"/>
...

```



 The logs are rotated by default. When debug is enabled, it makes sense to increase the `value` attribute of `maxBackupIndex` element to affect the number of preserved log files. While doing so, ensure there is sufficient free disk space available.


```Plain Text
<appender ...>
    <param name="maxBackupIndex" value="10"/>
...

```



For detailed description of `maxBackupIndex` and other supported attributes, see [Class RollingFileAppender](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/RollingFileAppender.html) in Apache documentation.

## Reading Logs

Each message has a timestamp and level (`ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`).

Example:
```Shell
[2010-11-19 23:22:35,657] INFO - s.buildServer.SERVER - Agent vmWin2k3-3 has been registered with id 19, not running a build

```

* `ERROR` means an operation failed and some data was lost or action not performed. Generally, there should be no ERRORs in the log.
* `WARN` generally means that an operation failed, but will be retried or the operation is considered not important. Some amount of WARNs is OK. But you can review the log for such warnings to better understand what is going OK and what is not.
* `INFO` is an informational message that just reports on the current activities.
* `DEBUG` is only useful for issue investigation, for example, to be analyzed by TeamCity developers.

### General Logging Configuration

By defaul,t TeamCity searches for log4j configuration in the `.../conf/teamcity-server-log4j.xml` file (this resolves to `<`[`TeamCity Server home`](teamcity-home-directory.md)`>/conf/teamcity-server-log4j.xml` for TeamCity `.exe` and `.tar.gz` distributions when run from `bin`). If no such file is present, the default log4j configuration is used. The logs are saved to the `../logs` directory by default.

The configuration options values can be changed via the corresponding `log4j.configuration` and `teamcity_logs` JVM options or [internal properties](configuring-teamcity-server-startup-properties.md).   
For example: `log4j.configuration=file:../conf/teamcity-server-log4j.xml` and `teamcity_logs=../logs/`.   
Default values can be looked up in the `bin/teamcity-server` script available in the .exe and tar.gz distributions.

If you start TeamCity by the means other than the bundled `teamcity-server` or `runAll` scripts, make sure to pass the above\-mentioned options to the server JVM. See also the [recommendations](installing-and-configuring-the-teamcity-server.md) on installing TeamCity into not bundled web server.

The default `teamcity-server-log4j.xml` file content can be found in the `.exe` and `tar.gz` distributions. The one with debug enabled can be found under `<`[`TeamCity Data Directory`](teamcity-data-directory.md)`>/config/_logging/debug-general.xml` name after server's first start. See also the sample [`teamcity-server-log4j.xml`](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/download/attachments/113084044/teamcity-server-log4j.xml?version=1&modificationDate=1362486616000&api=v2) file.
