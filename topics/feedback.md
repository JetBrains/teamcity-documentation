## Licensed Users Support
{id="Licensed+Users+Support" instance="tc"}

You can contact us via the [online support form](https://teamcity-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=66621){nullable="true"} or [email](mailto:teamcity-support@jetbrains.com?body=Affected%20TeamCity%20version:%20%3Cversion%20and%20build%20number%3E) if you own a TeamCity Enterprise server license with the active maintenance period and need the error report not to be publicly available. Only [two latest major TeamCity releases](teamcity-release-cycle.md) and their bugfix updates are covered by our support.

However, we would appreciate if you post your question in the forums as this allows other users to share their experience. If, for some reason, there is a delay in responding to the question in the forum, feel free to ping us via email noting the forum post you have created.

We prefer to keep our support efforts as close to the development team as possible, and you will often get answers from the actual developer of the related TeamCity feature. We are ready to offer technical support services in the English language during the business hours of 10:00 - 18:00 CET/CEST (Germany, GMT+1/GMT+2 [timezone](https://timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=168)).

Our usual response time is 24 hours excluding public holidays in [Germany/Bavaria](https://publicholidays.de/bavaria/). If you experience an urgent issue, please indicate this in the subject of the email message and detail the nature of the urgency.   
If you own more than 30 agent licenses and have an urgent issue affecting your TeamCity installation (like production server outage without a workaround), you can use the `teamcity-support-urgent` mailbox at the `jetbrains.com` domain — we process these messages before others, if possible. For the same effect, you can also mark an issue as "_Production outage_" when using the online form.   
If you do not receive a reply within 48 hours, please check your spam filter and feel free to repeat the message referencing the previous one. 

Please note that our support is restricted to TeamCity-specific issues and does not cover issues related to third-party TeamCity plugins, inappropriate environment configuration for a server application, and so on.


## Licensed Users Support
{id="Licensed+Users+Support+Cloud" instance="tcc"}

If you have an active TeamCity Cloud subscription and require your error report to remain private, please contact us via the [online support form](https://teamcity-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360003300299&product_type=teamcity_cloud){nullable="true"} or [email](mailto:teamcity-support@jetbrains.com?body=Affected%20TeamCity%20version:%20%3Cversion%20and%20build%20number%3E).

We encourage you to post your questions in the forums, as it helps other users benefit from shared experiences. If you experience a delay in receiving a response on the forum, feel free to email us, referencing the forum post you created. Our support team works closely with the development team, so you may receive responses directly from the developer responsible for the relevant TeamCity feature.

We strive to respond promptly, usually within a few hours of receiving your issue (excluding [public holidays in Germany/Bavaria](https://publicholidays.de/bavaria/)). For urgent matters, please indicate the urgency in the subject line and explain its nature.


Please note that our support is limited to TeamCity-specific issues and does not extend to third-party plugins or custom tools installed on self-hosted agents.
