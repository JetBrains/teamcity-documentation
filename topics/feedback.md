This section details our support services, contact information, and best practices for contacting JetBrains to get TeamCity support and send your feedback on the product.

Before requesting support, we suggest that you check if the answer is already available in:
* online documentation: [Common Problems](common-problems.md), [Known Issues](known-issues.md), [Licensing Policy](licensing-policy.md)
{product="tc"}
* online documentation: [Common Problems](common-problems.md), [Known Issues](known-issues.md)
  {product="tcc"}
* [public issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/TW)
* [community forum](http://jb.gg/teamcity-forum)

Contact us about:
* _a technical question or an idea_ — [community forum](http://jb.gg/teamcity-forum), "New Post" action (public)
* _a bug or a feature request_ — [issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/TW) (public, with an option of private comments/attachments)
* _a license/purchase question_ — JetBrains [sales department](http://www.jetbrains.com/company/contacts/#contactSales) (private)
* _not a public question, and you have an active TeamCity Enterprise server license_ — [online form](https://teamcity-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=66621) or [email](mailto:teamcity-support@jetbrains.com?body=Affected%20TeamCity%20version:%20%3Cversion%20and%20build%20number%3E) (private, faster response times)

When submitting a request, make sure:
{product="tc"}
* to provide all necessary information by reviewing the [Reporting Issues guidelines](reporting-issues.md#Best+Practices+When+Reporting+Issues);
{product="tc"}
* you use a [recent TeamCity version](previous-releases-downloads.md). Generally, we do not provide regular support for [non-current major versions](teamcity-release-cycle.md) older than one year.

## Licensed Users Support

You can contact us via the [online support form](https://teamcity-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=66621) or [email](mailto:teamcity-support@jetbrains.com?body=Affected%20TeamCity%20version:%20%3Cversion%20and%20build%20number%3E) if you own a TeamCity Enterprise server license with the active maintenance period and need the error report not to be publicly available. Only [two latest major TeamCity releases](teamcity-release-cycle.md) and their bugfix updates are covered by our support.   
However, we would appreciate if you post your question in the forums as this allows other users to share their experience. If, for some reason, there is a delay in responding to the question in the forum, feel free to ping us via email noting the forum post you have created.

We prefer to keep our support efforts as close to the development team as possible, and you will often get answers from the actual developer of the related TeamCity feature.   
We are ready to offer technical support services in the English language during the business hours of 10:00 - 18:00 CET/CEST (Germany, GMT+1/GMT+2 [timezone](http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=168)).

Our usual response time is 24 hours excluding public holidays in [Germany/Bavaria](https://publicholidays.de/bavaria/) and/or [Russian Federation](http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/russia/). If you experience an urgent issue, please indicate this in the subject of the email message and detail the nature of the urgency.   
If you own more than 30 agent licenses and have an urgent issue affecting your TeamCity installation (like production server outage without a workaround), you can use the `teamcity-support-urgent` mailbox at the `jetbrains.com` domain — we process these messages before others, if possible. For the same effect, you can also mark an issue as "_Production outage_" when using the online form.   
If you do not receive a reply within 48 hours, please check your spam filter and feel free to repeat the message referencing the previous one. 

### Phone Support

We do not provide regular phone support as technical issues are often better resolved over email where you can send logs, screenshots, and so on.   
As an experiment to better handle urgent cases, we have a direct access phone line __+49 89 255-596-587__ (usual availability times within working days are 11:00 — 18:00 CET/CEST (Germany, GMT+1/GMT+2 timezone). While we do not guarantee your call will be answered at all times, it is another quick-access alternative for emergency issues, and chances are high you will receive the support. Prior to calling, please send us a detailed email message describing the issue.

Please note that our support is restricted to TeamCity-specific issues and does not cover issues related to third-party TeamCity plugins, inappropriate environment configuration for a server application, and so on.

## Data Security

We encourage making your postings publicly available so that other users can both comment based on their experience and benefit from the answers.   
All JetBrains community forum data is public. The JetBrains issue tracker issue details are public as well.

If you need to share data that is not meant to be publicly available, you can use the following methods:
* Post a comment or attachment to the issue in the JetBrains [issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/TW), visible only to the `teamcity-developers` group.
* Attach data to the support system ticket or send it in an email to [`teamcity-support@jetbrains.com`](mailto:teamcity-support@jetbrains.com).
* For data volumes exceeding 10 Mb: upload them to our [uploads server](reporting-issues.md#Uploading+Large+Data+Archives).

All data received with a note on its non-public nature is used only for the related issue investigation and is discarded afterwards.   
While in transfer and while stored, the data can be kept on third-party servers like mail servers, Amazon AWS servers, ZenDesk support system, and so on.
