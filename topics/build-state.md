The build state icon appears next to each build under the expanded view of the build configuration on the __Projects__ page.

### Canceled/Stopped build

Stopping a running build results in the build status displayed as cancelled. You can stop a running build from the [__Build Results__](working-with-build-results.md), [__Build Configuration Home__](build-configuration-home-page.md) or using the __Stop__ option from the __Actions__ drop-down menu.

When a build is started, the build process calls the runner process and listens to its output. The stop command kills the runner process, then the build process stops.

<note>

It is possible to configure your build so that it will continue executing build steps after the build was stopped. To do it, can add a build step with the __Always, even if build stop command was issued__ option selected. See [Configuring Build Steps](configuring-build-steps.md).

## Hanging and Outdated Builds

TeamCity considers a build as _hanging_ when its run time significantly exceeds estimated average run time and the build did not send any messages since the estimation exceeded.

A running build can be marked as _Outdated_ if there is a build which contains more changes but it is already finished.Hanging and outdated builds appear with the icon ![attentionComment.png](attentionComment.png). Move the cursor over the icon to view a tooltip that displays additional information about the warning.

## Failed to Start Builds

Builds which failed to start, that is which did not get to the point of launching the first build step are marked with the ![redSign.png](redSign.png) icon. It may be caused by a VCS repository being down when the build starts, or the inability to resolve artifact dependencies and so on. Such build status is often an indication of a configuration error and should usually be addressed by a build engineer rather than a developer.   
If such an error occurs, TeamCity:
* doesn't send build failed notification (unless you have subscribed to "the build fails to start" notification)
* doesn't associate pending changes with this build, that is the changes will remain pending, because they were not actually tested
* doesn't show such build as the last finished build on the overview page
* such builds will not affect the build configuration status and the status of developer changes
* shows a "configuration error" stripe for a build configuration with such a build


## Project and Build Configuration Icons

<snippet id="color-coding">

A build's success or failure affects its color and the colors of its parent configuration and project. Color-coded icons provide a bird's eye view of the build farm, enabling you to instantly spot problematic projects.

TeamCity object icons have three distinctive colors:

<deflist>
<def title="Gray">

<img src="dk-icons-gray.png" width="660" alt="Gray project and configuration icons" style="block"/>

* Build: not yet started (queued) or cancelled.
* Configuration: either the selected branch has no builds, or the default branch doesn't (for the side navigation tree and **&lt;All branches&gt;** view).
* Project: neither of the project configurations have builds.

</def>

<def title="Green">

<img src="dk-icons-green.png" width="660" alt="Green project and configuration icons" style="block"/>

* Build: successfully finished or running without any issues.
* Configuration: the last build for a selected or default branch was successful.
* Project: **all** of its configurations are green.

</def>

<def title="Red">

<img src="dk-icons-red.png" width="660" alt="Red project and configuration icons" style="block"/>

* Build: failed or still running but encountered a problem.
* Configuration: the last build for a selected or default branch failed.
* Project: at least one of its configurations is red.

</def>
</deflist>

The following images illustrate the same configuration with builds in three different branches: "main" (default branch), "development", and "sandbox".

* The last "development" branch build was successful. If this branch is selected, the configuration icon is green.

    <img src="dk-confbuttons-green.png" width="706" alt="Green configuration icons"/>

* The last "sandbox" branch build failed. If this branch is selected, the configuration icon is red.

    <img src="dk-confbuttons-red.png" width="706" alt="Red configuration icons"/>

* The default "main" branch has no builds, so configuration icons in both side navigation tree and **&lt;All branches&gt;** view are gray. The same "unknown" status applies to the entire project, since this is its only configuration.
