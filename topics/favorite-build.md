## Adding Builds to Favorites

To manually add a build to your favorites, use the appropriate option from the __Actions__ menu on the [Build Results](working-with-build-results.md) page. Your favorite build will be marked with a star symbol ![star_filled.png](star_filled.png).

Any of your manually triggered builds and [personal builds](personal-build.md) can be added to your favorites automatically if you enable the corresponding setting in your [user profile settings](managing-your-user-account.md).

You can also add a custom build to favorites by checking the [corresponding box](triggering-a-custom-build.md#Comment+and+Tags).

To view your favorites, in the top right corner of the TeamCity web UI, click the arrow next to your username, and select __My Favorite Builds__.

You can also configure notifications on your favorite builds using the appropriate link on this page.

## Configuring Notifications on Your Favorite Builds
