## Adding Builds to Favorites

To manually add a build to your favorites, use the appropriate option from the __Actions__ menu on the __[Build Results](working-with-build-results.md)__ page. Your favorite build will be marked with a star symbol ![star_filled.png](star_filled.png).

Any of your manually triggered builds and [personal builds](personal-build.md) can be added to your favorites automatically if you enable the corresponding setting in your [user profile settings](configuring-your-user-profile.md).

You can also add a custom build to favorites by checking the [corresponding box](running-custom-build.md#Comment+and+Tags).

You can also configure notifications on your favorite builds using the appropriate link on this page.

## Configuring Notifications on Your Favorite Builds
