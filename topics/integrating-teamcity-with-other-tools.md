[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Integrating TeamCity with Other Tools)

One of the key features of TeamCity is straightforward integration with modern software technologies and platforms. To ensure our users are able to integrate every component of their CI/CD pipeline with TeamCity, we either:
* provide smart detection and handy UI controls on the TeamCity side, or
* expose specialized [REST API](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/rest/teamcity-rest-api-documentation.html) endpoints for easier scripting and integration on a third-party system's side.

There are many places in the TeamCity UI where you can set up or adjust software integrations, depending on their context. This article gives an overview of third-party software and platforms supported in TeamCity out of the box. Remember that you can extend this scope by [installing additional plugins](installing-additional-plugins.md) or even [writing your own ones](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/teamcity/developing-teamcity-plugins.html).  
See also [versions of platforms and environments](supported-platforms-and-environments.md) currently supported in TeamCity.
