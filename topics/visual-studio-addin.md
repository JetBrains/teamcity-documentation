## Add-in Features

The TeamCity add-in for Microsoft Visual Studio provides the following features:
* [Remote Run](remote-run.md) for TFS, Subversion and Perforce (for remote run for Mercurial and Git see [Branch Remote Run Trigger](branch-remote-run-trigger.md))
* [Pre-Tested (Delayed) Commit](pre-tested-delayed-commit.md) for TFS, Subversion and Perforce
* fetching [JetBrains dotCover](http://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/index.html) coverage analysis data from the TeamCity server (see [more](jetbrains-dotcover.md)) to MS Visual Studio (requires dotCover of the [supported version](supported-platforms-and-environments.md#Code+Coverage) installed in Visual Studio)
* viewing recently committed changes and personal builds with their build status in the __My Changes__ tool window
* opening build failure details in MS Visual Studio from the TeamCity web UI
* viewing failed tests' details for a build
* reruning tests failed in the TeamCity build locally via the [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) test runner
* navigation from the IDE to the build results web page
* reapplying changes sent in Remote Run or Pre-tested commit to the working directory

For detailed instructions, refer to the [TeamCity Add-in Online Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/vs-addin/TeamCity_Getting_Started.html).

<tip>

To enable navigation to the failed tests in MS Visual Studio by using _Open in IDE_ actions in the web UI, make sure that `.pdb` file generation for the assemblies involved in NUnit/MSTest unit tests is switched on in the current Visual Studio project.

## Installing Add-in

1. Close all running instances of Visual Studio before starting the Add-in installation (initial or upgrade).
2. Navigate to the download page of the Visual Studio Add-in:
   * Click the arrow next to your username in the top right corner of the TeamCity web UI and select __My Settings &amp; Tools__.
   * In the __TeamCity Tools__ section on the right, click the Visual Studio Add\-in download link.

The TeamCity Visual Studio Add-in is shipped as a part of [ReSharper Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotnet/) products bundle. After installation, the TeamCity Add\-in will be available under the RESHARPER menu in Visual Studio.

<note>

The installer will remove the prebundled products' versions: TeamCity and ReSharper versions prior to 9.0, dotCover prior to 3.0, dotTrace prior to 6.0. ReSharper Ultimate does not support the Visual Studio versions 2005 and 2008.
</note>

The Legacy version of the TeamCity VS Add-in for Visual Studio versions from 2005 to 2013 compatible with JetBrains .NET tools prior to ReSharper 9.0, dotCover 3.0 and dotTrace 6.0 is not available since __TeamCity 10.0__.
