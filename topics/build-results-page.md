[//]: # (title: Build Results Page)
[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Build Results Page;Build History)

In TeamCity, all information about a build, whether it is queued, running or finished, is accumulated on its __Build Results__ page. This page can be accessed from the __Build Configuration Home__ page and from various places in the TeamCity UI where a build number or build status appears as a link, when browsing in the __[Home](working-with-build-results.md)__ mode. Some data is accessible only after the build is finished, some details like Changes, Parameters, and Dependencies are also applicable to the build while it is waiting in the queue.

This article gives an overview of the __Build Results__ page of the new TeamCity UI. Most of its features are also available in the classic UI mode.

## Internal Build ID

Knowing a build ID can be required when working with [REST API](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/rest/teamcity-rest-api-documentation.html) or [downloading build artifacts](patterns-for-accessing-build-artifacts.md). You can obtain this ID from the URL or the **Parameters** tab of the __Build Results__ page.

The URL of the __Build Results__ page typically looks like the following:

* In Sakura UI: `<SERVER_URL>/buildConfiguration/<CONFIGURATION_ID>/<BUILD_ID>?...`.
* In Classic UI: `<SERVER_URL>/viewLog.html?buildId=<BUILD_ID>&buildTypeId=<CONFIGURATION_ID>&...`

The `<BUILD_ID>` portion is the internal numeric build ID uniquely identifying this build in TeamCity.

You can also find the same value under the build's **Parameters** tab in TeamCity UI, stored in the `teamcity.build.id` parameter.



## Build Results Title Panel

The __Build Results__ page contains several tabs, whose set depends on the current build's specifics, and a few common elements:

* Branch selector which displays the branch of the current build. When in __Build Configuration Home__, this selector allows actually filtering the list of displayed builds by a specfic branch.
* The __Actions__ menu (described [here](build-actions.md)).
* The __Details__ block: when expanded, shows the main info about the current block.
* The __Investigation__ widget which lets you quickly assign an [investigation](investigating-and-muting-build-failures.md) of this build or see the details of the open investigation.
* The __Trends__ widget which shows all the previous builds and their details. Hover a build to see its details.

## Overview Tab

The __Overview__ tab displays general information about the build, such as the build duration, the agent used, trigger, and dependencies. The set of tabs depends on the steps and specifics of the current build. If a build is queued, the tab displays the position of the build in the queue, the time the build is supposed to start, and so on.

It also shows the diagnostic messages related to the current build's status.

## Changes Tab

The __Changes__ tab displays information about changes in the build and provides advanced filtering capabilities for the list of changes. 
You can filter changes by their author, comment, path, and revision.

To view changes from dependencies, check the corresponding box.

You can view modified files by checking the __Show files__ box. Clicking a filename opens the diff viewer.

Enabling __Show graph__ displays the changes as a graph of commits to the VCS roots related to this build.
The graph appears on the left of the list and presents the changes with a variable level of detailing, allowing you to:

* Navigate to a graph node to display the VCS root revision number.
* View the VCS roots which were changed in this build: on hovering over the area on the left of the changes list, each of the roots is highlighted as a bar.
* Click a bar to select a single VCS root. Only the changes pertaining to this root are visible, others are grayed out.
* If there have been merges between the branches of the repository, the graph displays them. 
* If your VCS root has subrepositories (marked S in the list of changes), navigate to a node in the parent to see which commits in subrepositories are referenced by this revision in the parent.


From the __Changes__ tab, you can:
* Review all changes included in the build with their corresponding [revisions](revision.md) in version control.
    * Review changes included in the build that the current build depends on: if the current build configuration has an artifact dependency, and the artifact downloaded in the current build has changed compared to the one downloaded in the previous build of the current configuration, the __Artifact dependencies changes__ node appears displaying the build which was used to download artifact dependencies from, and the changes which were included in that build.
* [Label the build sources](vcs-labeling.md).
* [Configure the VCS settings](configuring-vcs-settings.md) of the build configuration (if you have enough permissions).

For each change on this page, you can:
* Explore the change in details.
* View which dependent build the changes come from or builds with snapshot dependencies with the "_Show changes from snapshot dependencies_" option enabled.
* Navigate to the __Change Details__ by clicking a changed file link.
* [Trigger a custom build](running-custom-build.md) with this change.
* Download the patch.
* Download the patch to your IDE.
* Review the change in an [external change viewer](external-changes-viewer.md), if configured by the administrator.

## Build Log Tab

The graphic build log timeline reflects the duration of each build stage and indicates build problems:

<img src="build-timeline.png" width="600" alt="Build timeline"/>

Click any stage to open the corresponding line of the build log.

More information on build logs in TeamCity is available [here](build-log.md).

## Artifacts Tab

If the build produced [artifacts](build-artifact.md), they all are displayed on the dedicated __Artifacts__ tab.

## Parameters Tab

The **Parameters** tab shows all actual (at the time of this build) values of [build parameters](configuring-build-parameters.md). 

<include from="levels-and-priority-of-build-parameters.md" element-id="build-results-parameters-tab"/>


## Dependencies Tab

If a finished build has artifact and/or snapshot dependencies, the __Dependencies__ tab is displayed on the __Build Results__ page. Here you can explore builds whose artifacts and/or sources were used for creating this build (downloaded artifacts) as well as the builds which used the artifacts and/or sources of the current build (delivered artifacts). Additionally, you can view indirect dependencies for the build. That is, for example, if build A depends on build B which depends on builds C and D, then these builds C and D are indirect dependencies for build A.

The __Dependencies__ tab provides three modes of displaying the build dependencies: a visual timeline, structured list, and build chain. Choose the mode that is the most helpful for your current task.

<img src="exp-dependencies-tab.png" alt="Dependencies Tab of Build Results" width="706"/>

The "Timeline" and "List" view modes allow you to search for specific builds by their names.

<img src="dk-searchDependencies.png" alt="Find Panel in dependencies" width="706"/>

## Issues Tab

If you have [integration with an issue tracker](integrating-teamcity-with-issue-tracker.md) configured and if there is at least one issue mentioned in the comments for the included changes or in the comments for the build itself, you will see the list of issues related to the current build in the __Issues__ tab.

>If you need to view all the issues related to a build configuration and not just to particular build, you can navigate to the __Issues Log__ tab available on the __Build Configuration Home__ page, where you can see all the issues mapped to the comments or filter the list to particular range of builds.

## Code Coverage Tab

If you have code coverage configured in your build runner, the __Code Coverage__ tab with the full HTML code coverage report will appear.

By clicking the links in the __Coverage Breakdown__ section, you can drill down to display statistics for different scopes: for example, Namespace, Assembly, Method, and Source Code.

## Code Inspection Tab

If configured, the results of a [Code Inspection](configuring-test-reports-and-code-coverage.md#Code+Inspection+in+TeamCity) build step are shown on the __Code Inspection__ tab. Use the left pane to navigate through the inspection results; the filtered inspections are shown in the right pane.
* Switch from the __Total__ to __Errors__ option, if you are not interested in warnings.
* Use the scope filter to limit the view to the specific directories. This makes it easier for developers to manage specific code of interest.
* Use the inspections tree view under the scope filter to display results by specific inspection.
* Note that TeamCity displays the source code line number that contains the problem. Click it to jump the code in your IDE.

## Duplicates

If your build configuration has Duplicates build runner as one of the build steps, you will see the __Duplicates__ tab in the __Build Results__.

The tab consists of:
* A list of duplicates found. The __new only__ option enables you to show only the duplicates that appeared in the latest build.
* A list of files containing these duplicates. Use the left and right arrow buttons to show selected duplicate in the respective pane in the lower part of the tab.
* Two panes with the source code of the file fragments that contain duplicates.
* Scope filter in the upper-left corner lists the specific directories that contain the duplicates. This filtering makes it easier for developers to manage the code of interest.

## Tests Tab

The __Tests__ tab allows switching between failed, ignored, and succeeded tests, and use various filters.

For each failed test, you can view its stacktrace, the diff between the expected and actual values, jump to the test history, [assign a team member to investigate its failure](investigating-and-muting-build-failures.md), [open the test in your IDE](installing-tools.md) and/or start fixing it right away.

>Watch our **video tutorial** on how to [use the test report page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKJjcBJT1k0).

To see a detailed test or investigation history, click __Show test history__ or __Show investigation history__ in its context menu.

Clicking the __Show test history__ link opens the __Test details__ page where you can find following information:
* The test details, including the test success rate and test's run duration data and graph.
* A complete test history table containing information about the test's status, its duration, and information on the builds this test was run in.

### Test Duration Graph

The Test Duration graph is useful for comparing the amount of time it takes individual tests to run on the builds of this build configuration.

Test duration results are only available for the builds which are currently in the build history. Once a build has been [cleaned up](teamcity-data-clean-up.md), this data is no longer available.

You can perform the following actions on the Test Duration Graph:
* Filter out the builds that failed the test by clearing the __Show failed__ option.
* Calculate the daily average values by selecting the __Average__ option.
* Click a dot plotted on the graph to jump to the page with the results of the corresponding build.
* View a build summary in the tooltip of a dot on the graph and navigate to the corresponding __Build Results__ page.
* Filter information by agents selecting or clearing a particular agent or by clicking __All__ or __None__ links to select or clear all agents.

## Maven Build Info Tab

For each Maven build, a build agent gathers Maven-specific build details to be displayed on the __Maven Build Info__ tab after the build finish. This tab can be useful for build engineers when adjusting build configurations.

## Classic UI Tabs

Other classic UI tabs, not yet reproduced in the new UI, are also available: click __More__ and select the required tab in the list. To view the sections described below, yu can also temporarily switch to the classic UI via the respective toggle in the upper right corner.

### Build History in Classic UI

_Build history_ is a record of the past builds produced by TeamCity. It is displayed as the __Trends__ widget in the new UI and as the menu with links in the classic UI, which is described below.

To view the history of builds in the current configuration, click __previous__ and __next__ links in the upper right corner of __Build Results__. Click __All history__ link to open the __History__ tab.

Navigation menu:

<img src="history-buttons.png" alt="Navigate through history" width="228"/>

The __History__ tab:

<img src="build-history.png" alt="Build history" width="1312"/>

### Tests History in Classic UI

The __Tests__ tab of the classic UI differs from the new version and contains a few unique features, such as the ability to download all tests in CSV and pop-up duration graph images. You can temporarily switch to it whenever you need its capabilities.
