## Support Tiers

JetBrains offers three tiers of support: Standard support (included with all active Enterprise server and TeamCity Cloud licenses), Business support, and Enterprise support. The Business and Enterprise support plans are optional paid plans that provide additional benefits, such as 24/7 availability, a private Slack channel, and varying service-level agreements (SLAs) for response times. For more details, visit the [Support plans](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/support/#plans) page.

## Availability

Support is provided Monday through Friday, during Central European business hours. Our typical response time is within 24 hours, excluding weekends and public holidays in Central Europe.

Support is restricted to TeamCity-specific issues and does not cover issues related to third-party TeamCity plugins, inappropriate environment configuration for a server application, or similar concerns.

## Submitting a Ticket

You can contact us by:

* completing the [online support form](https://teamcity-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=66621)

* or emailing [teamcity-support@jetbrains.com](mailto:teamcity-support@jetbrains.com)

Both methods will generate a ticket in our ticketing system, Zendesk.

TeamCity Enterprise users can go to **Help | Submit support request** to quickly navigate to the online support form with some of the data prepopulated (such as the server version).

If you experience an urgent issue, please indicate this when submitting the support form or in the subject line of your email message, and detail the nature of the urgency.

## Production outage

If you experience a production server outage without an available workaround, you can use the `teamcity-support-urgent` alias at the `jetbrains.com` domain. These tickets are prioritized for review whenever possible. Alternatively, you can mark your ticket as a “Production outage” when completing the online support form.

Customers who have purchased an [optional Business or Enterprise support plan](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/support/#plans) will have appropriate SLAs automatically applied to their production outage tickets.
